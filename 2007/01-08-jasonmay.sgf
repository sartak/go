;W[gg]
;B[df]C[sartak [17k\]: I really don't know if I should play in the center or on a side with that first move
]
;W[eg]
;B[ff]
;W[ef]C[amni [1k\]: center is actually a fine way to begin 4 handi games. i've seen high dans play it against low dans many times
]
;B[fg]C[amni [1k\]: there is a proverb for that too. "play on the point of symmetry"
]
;W[fh]C[amni [1k\]: almost everything is a proverb. :)

;B[ee]
;W[hd]
;B[ie]
;W[fe]
;B[gf]
;W[hf]C[amni [1k\]: they did an analysis of a professional game on sensei's library (I think) and found that of the first 100 moves, all but 2 followed from some proverb
jasonmay [?\]: ladder trap again :(
jasonmay [?\]: or wait
jasonmay [?\]: I might regret this

;W[fb]
;B[gb]
;W[hb]C[jasonmay [?\]: ow
sartak [17k\]: I really screwed up in trying to continue with the ladder
sartak [17k\]: I should've re-evaluated my position after you played J9
jasonmay [?\]: I noticed
sartak [17k\]: F9 was in atari for a little while, if you had captured it I woulda been up the creek
amni [1k\]: a ladder that's screwed up can still be useful. look up "driving tesuji" on sensei's.

;B[fc]
;W[ec]
;B[dg]C[jasonmay [?\]: ah shit
jasonmay [?\]: fuck fuck
sartak [17k\]: heh
]
;W[eb]C[jasonmay [?\]: hm
sartak [17k\]: hmmmmmmmmmmm
jasonmay [?\]: maybe not so fuck fuck
]
;B[eh]C[sartak [17k\]: yeah ;_;
sartak [17k\]: hi seanbo
sartak [17k\]: y
sartak [17k\]: welcome to sartak sucks at go
amni [1k\]: you're so hard on yourself
]
;W[ga]
;B[hc]
;W[ic]
;B[eg]
;W[id]
;B[hg]C[sartak [17k\]: a cut there would've been painful for me
]
;W[gh]C[jasonmay [?\]: I suck at foreseeing connections
]
;B[ib]
;W[ha]C[jasonmay [?\]: hmm
jasonmay [?\]: it looks like if I cut you, you'll just make an eye
jasonmay [?\]: but is that worse than a connection?
jasonmay [?\]: nevermind
jasonmay [?\]: I think it'll be a false eye anywa
jasonmay [?\]: y
]
;B[fa]
;W[ea]C[jasonmay [?\]: but that's a lot of moves to make
jasonmay [?\]: eh
jasonmay [?\]: we'll see how it turns out
sartak [17k\]: talkative :)
jasonmay [?\]: I'm also twirling my hair
jasonmay [?\]: which is a sign of desparate thinking
jasonmay [?\]: by the way
jasonmay [?\]: you have inspired me to grow my hair out
sartak [17k\]: :)
amni [1k\]: F13 is a very normal move actually
jasonmay [?\]: it will be a nifty surprise when Janel sees me in February :)
amni [1k\]: it was my first instinct in this position too
]
;B[if]C[sartak [17k\]: bah! good move :)
sartak [17k\]: you probably did it to capture that group but it also foils my plans
]
;W[jc]C[jasonmay [?\]: heh, yeah
sartak [17k\]: It would've put J9 into atari, which I figure you'd extend
]
;B[fi]C[sartak [17k\]: then I play a net at J6 to connect
amni [1k\]: the J8 atari would actually be better at K11, followed by connecting at K12
]
;W[gi]C[jasonmay [?\]: man I was gonna play my first intended double atari trap ever
]
;B[kb]
;W[jb]
;B[hh]C[jasonmay [?\]: bah
jasonmay [?\]: meh
]
;W[ig]
;B[jf]
;W[ii]C[amni [1k\]: basic strategy for white in high handicap games is "cut everywhere and hope something dies"
jasonmay [?\]: ooh, good OSI song
jasonmay [?\]: (once)
sartak [17k\]: Free (the song) reminds me of Emily
jasonmay [?\]: cool
jasonmay [?\]: ah shit
jasonmay [?\]: I didn't even see that double atari
sartak [17k\]: hmm
]
;B[hi]
;W[gj]C[jasonmay [?\]: I think I have your hmm called
jasonmay [?\]: yeah
sartak [17k\]: :)
]
;B[hj]C[sartak [17k\]: see, I'm just not very good
sartak [17k\]: amni doesn't make these kinds of mistakes
jasonmay [?\]: twice your talking has saved me
]
;W[ij]
;B[hk]C[sartak [17k\]: yeah I need to be careful
sartak [17k\]: maybe say hmm as a bluff
jasonmay [?\]: now that's just diry
jasonmay [?\]: dirty*
]
;W[ih]
;B[gk]
;W[fj]
;B[ei]C[sartak [17k\]: :)
sartak [17k\]: I was hoping you'd try to net me
]
;W[fk]C[sartak [17k\]: though hmm, I think I still would've died there, heh
amni [1k\]: omg  i make such terrible mistakes, you have no idea
sartak [17k\]: not that my prospects for life are currently very good
]
;B[fl]
;W[ek]C[jasonmay [?\]: I dont' know what to do so you're at somewhat of an advantage until I get a grasp on things
sartak [17k\]: :)
]
;B[dk]
;W[el]
;B[em]
;W[dl]
;B[cl]
;W[dm]C[jasonmay [?\]: I really hope that's a try eye up ther
jasonmay [?\]: e
sartak [17k\]: E8?
jasonmay [?\]: yeah
sartak [17k\]: yep
jasonmay [?\]: so then, hmm
sartak [17k\]: but that group has a ton of liberties and a ton of influence so you don't need to worry
jasonmay [?\]: oh, right
]
;B[cm]
;W[fm]C[jasonmay [?\]: aahhhhhh fuck
]
;B[gl]
;W[ik]C[jasonmay [?\]: I don't like you
sartak [17k\]: you'll like me even less after this one:
sartak [17k\]: hmm
jasonmay [?\]: I see what you're doing
jasonmay [?\]: I think it's dead actually
jasonmay [?\]: hi stumbly
sartak [17k\]: heya
sartak [17k\]: I mentioned our game in a nethack channel
]
;B[il]
;W[gm]C[jasonmay [?\]: again, I miss the consequence of the connection
]
;B[hl]C[jasonmay [?\]: time to escape

;B[jm]
;W[im]
;B[hm]
;W[im]C[sartak [17k\]: snapback'd
jasonmay [?\]: oh

sartak [17k\]: hmm!

;W[kf]C[arcnae: everything is so much straighter in this game
]
;B[je]
;W[kd]C[jasonmay [?\]: ah it was dead no matter what
]
;B[mi]
;W[lg]C[jasonmay [?\]: :'(
sartak [17k\]: I'm still overplaying
amni [1k\]: untrue
amni [1k\]: everything since F1 at least has been totally honest
jasonmay [?\]: the entire right half is dead
sartak [17k\]: yeah
]
;B[ck]
;W[cc]C[jasonmay [?\]: I'm incapable of weighing the consequences
]
;B[cb]
;W[db]
;B[ca]
;W[ka]
;B[la]
;W[bb]C[jasonmay [?\]: where did you just go?
arcnae: B12
sartak [17k\]: B12, it should be circled..?
jasonmay [?\]: oh, didn't notice it gets circled
sartak [17k\]: heh..
sartak [17k\]: you're something, jason
arcnae: only took 103 moves
amni [1k\]: joan's yam
sartak [17k\]: B12 was another overplay
sartak [17k\]: ah well
amni [1k\]: b12 was not overplay you lunatic
arcnae: in my ever so new opinion, agreed
jasonmay [?\]: what's overplay?
sartak [17k\]: <@aioli> b12 was not overplay, you are insane
sartak [17k\]: apparently I dunno :)
jasonmay [?\]: looks tactful to me
jasonmay [?\]: C12 and C13 are dead now I think
sartak [17k\]: I was thinking B11 was suitable
]
;B[bc]
;W[bd]C[jasonmay [?\]: oof
sartak [17k\]: _for me_ :)
jasonmay [?\]: I know
jasonmay [?\]: I overlooked the extra liberty C11 had
amni [1k\]: B11 is a little better, and B10 was probably better still
amni [1k\]: if D12 were at D11 you could get away with B9

;B[cd]
;W[ac]
;B[be]
;W[ae]
;B[bf]C[sartak [17k\]: good
sartak [17k\]: That effectively stops my attack
]
;W[]C[sartak [17k\]: wait
sartak [17k\]: hmm
sartak [17k\]: eh well
]
;B[af]C[sartak [17k\]: yeah
]
;W[ad]C[sartak [17k\]: that's what I was hmming about
sartak [17k\]: I could try to invade that big area in the bottom right but I'll spare us both the effort :)
arcnae: ..bottom right?
jasonmay [?\]: I'm getting this feeling I can do something here, I just can't figure out what
sartak [17k\]: it's pretty much over
jasonmay [?\]: ok
sartak [17k\]: SIKE
arcnae: solid chunk of territory
sartak [17k\]: (just kidding :))
jasonmay [?\]: what are you kidding on?
sartak [17k\]: kidding about the SIKE
jasonmay [?\]: the psych or the thing before?
jasonmay [?\]: ok
sartak [17k\]: remember: I already passed
sartak [17k\]: so I'm clearly done
