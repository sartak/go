HanClinto [?\]: Thx
sartak [11k?\]: I was going to J6
HanClinto [?\]: It strengthened me, while forcing you to continue
sartak [11k?\]: but now, no thanks sailor :)

sartak [11k?\]: :)
HanClinto [?\]: If I played one stone out of place, you could have gotten a foothold in my back quarter, or captured stones
sartak [11k?\]: yup
HanClinto [?\]: Nicely done. :)
sartak [11k?\]: But I figure you've done that enough times to me now that you know to look for that
HanClinto [?\]: You didn't lose anything -- you spent moves, and all I've spent is putting more stones in territory in that I already control
sartak [11k?\]: :)
sartak [11k?\]: bingo
sartak [11k?\]: Wanna passpass?
HanClinto [?\]: Sure
sartak [11k?\]: <3 kgs
HanClinto [?\]: I could have spent time forcing you to clear them
