sartak [18k\]: eh it's okay
sartak [18k\]: We're not playing for real yet so it's no big deal
jasonmay: right'
sartak [18k\]: So in Go two players take turns putting stones onto the board, at intersections
sartak [18k\]: Hmm
jasonmay: ok
sartak [18k\]: Alrighty, you're up first
jasonmay: how many times can I go?
jasonmay: just once?
sartak [18k\]: Certain formations can't be captured
sartak [18k\]: OK I want to show you two more things, two special formations
