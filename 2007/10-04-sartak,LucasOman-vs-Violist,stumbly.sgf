;W[dd]C[Violist [?\]: so is this private chat or everyone sees?
]
;B[dj]C[sartak [?\]: everyone sees
Violist [?\]: ok, here's the secret plan
Violist [?\]: let's rush their base and kill them all
stumbly [?\]: all their base are belong to us
stumbly [?\]: gotcha
LucasOman [?\]: sartak: pms on fn
sartak [?\]: you're not supposed to coordinate out-of-band :)
LucasOman [?\]: oh

;B[cg]
;W[ec]C[Violist [?\]: I sense great power in this 'stumbly'
sartak [?\]: Lucas is very new to the game, just started learning last night
Violist [?\]: ok
Violist [?\]: general tip, then
LucasOman [?\]: at 2am *grumbles*
sartak [?\]: Violist: stumbly's a meatball
Violist [?\]: try to start off by placing stones loosely
Violist [?\]: you want to make a framework around territory
LucasOman [?\]: ah
Violist [?\]: not *too* loose or we can slip in and attack
Violist [?\]: but ... for instance
stumbly [?\]: mostly threats and gestures and loose connections
sartak [?\]: Go is largely a game of balance
]
;B[gg]C[sartak [?\]: of many many kinds
LucasOman [?\]: wait, let me express myself in interpretive dance
]
;W[fg]C[stumbly [?\]: that's why being stumbly is so dangerous
Violist [?\]: a play in the center there gives us a very strong influence on the bottom half of the board
sartak [?\]: :)
]
;B[ge]C[Violist [?\]: it's also a bad idea since it's so close to that strong white cluster
sartak [?\]: while the shape you made is strong
sartak [?\]: it's not very influential
sartak [?\]: the beginning of the game is about building influence
LucasOman [?\]: that makes sense
]
;W[cf]
;B[ff]C[Violist [?\]: and I like fighting too much...
]
;W[fh]
;B[ef]C[Violist [?\]: whew. Nice move :)
Violist [?\]: cut their forces in half...
sartak [?\]: we call that a "cut"
sartak [?\]: a CUT
Violist [?\]: now we just have to be sure we don't get surrounded in the process
]
;W[de]
;B[df]C[LucasOman [?\]: i guess i want to "fight"
]
;W[dg]C[LucasOman [?\]: since i've only played on a 9x9 so far hehe
sartak [?\]: a cut of their own
Violist [?\]: atari!
Violist [?\]: put him in atari!
sartak [?\]: nooo
]
;B[bf]C[sartak [?\]: wrong atari!
Violist [?\]: er
Violist [?\]: or that one
Violist [?\]: I was really thinking of killing his cut, but then, that gives us influence on the side...
stumbly [?\]: flipped a coin
Violist [?\]: fair enough :)
]
;W[ce]C[sartak [?\]: I think the lesson is
sartak [?\]: there's merit even in SHITTY moves!
sartak [?\]: ha ha ha
stumbly [?\]: thank gawd
LucasOman [?\]: just means i have a chance
]
;B[gi]C[sartak [?\]: ok
sartak [?\]: I was going to cut with F4
sartak [?\]: but now I'm just upset
Violist [?\]: :)
Violist [?\]: You Shall Not Have Eyes.
]
;W[bg]
;B[ch]C[sartak [?\]: what was that about eyelessness
]
;W[ci]C[LucasOman [?\]: was that a good move?
sartak [?\]: hehe
sartak [?\]: /me whistles loudly
sartak [?\]: I would've gone for B9
LucasOman [?\]: i mean, seemd like getting the cut would be good
LucasOman [?\]: ah... true
sartak [?\]: it's not a strong cut
sartak [?\]: they play D6
LucasOman [?\]: yeh...
sartak [?\]: it's ok
LucasOman [?\]: maybe it was premature
sartak [?\]: we're not looking too good anyway
stumbly [?\]: we'll see what mojo viol has
]
;B[dh]C[Violist [?\]: meh
stumbly [?\]: is this untimed?
sartak [?\]: they have influence over most of the board, we have.. the top left
Violist [?\]: I don't like D6 but I think it's the best I've got ATM
sartak [?\]: untimed, yes
sartak [?\]: so now I have to decide
sartak [?\]: do I save D7 and prolong the cut
sartak [?\]: or do I just cut and run ;)
Violist [?\]: cut your losses and run
Violist [?\]: I don't think D7 is getting out of this
sartak [?\]: right
sartak [?\]: F7 either
Violist [?\]: probably best to try to consolidate a position on the left side
sartak [?\]: so let's try to get some kind of life by building up on the side
]
;W[bh]C[sartak [?\]: that also finalizes the isolation of B8
stumbly [?\]: hrm think
]
;B[cc]C[sartak [?\]: since if black played B6 then B7 is captured
Violist [?\]: interesting...
Violist [?\]: so a fight for life in their only major bastion of territory?
Violist [?\]: Sounds like a party
sartak [?\]: \\o/
stumbly [?\]: bloodsport
LucasOman [?\]: your mom
]
;W[be]C[stumbly [?\]: she was just diagnosed with lymphoma, jerk
stumbly [?\]: :)
sartak [?\]: "insensitive clo"
sartak [?\]: clod
LucasOman [?\]: sob sb
]
;B[bd]C[LucasOman [?\]: my dad's had it twice
]
;W[cb]C[Violist [?\]: /me sucks at building life, btw.
stumbly [?\]: it's not too bad, early stage
]
;B[bi]C[Violist [?\]: uhh
Violist [?\]: that was not a good move
sartak [?\]: may I recommend a move, Lucas
Violist [?\]: just a free stone for them
stumbly [?\]: proly so
sartak [?\]: B4
LucasOman [?\]: why?
sartak [?\]: puts B5 in atari
stumbly [?\]: free cap
Violist [?\]: it'll kill B5
sartak [?\]: and from there it's easily captured
Violist [?\]: and gain you some more territroy
LucasOman [?\]: oh, gotcha
]
;W[bj]C[sartak [?\]: and yes, it extends our influence downward
stumbly [?\]: *maybe*
Violist [?\]: hmm
stumbly [?\]: sry viol, not thinking ahead enuf
Violist [?\]: fight for life, or defend
Violist [?\]: no problem
Violist [?\]: Any preferences? :)
stumbly [?\]: kill
stumbly [?\]: always kill
Violist [?\]: no need
]
;B[di]C[sartak [?\]: I'm not very assertive, please don't be aggressive
Violist [?\]: those guys are dead
]
;W[cj]C[Violist [?\]: what we need to worry about is holding our territroy
Violist [?\]: they need to focus on getting in
Violist [?\]: an invasion, or maybe with a bit of luck whittling points
]
;B[ck]C[sartak [?\]: punch the keys for God's sake!
sartak [?\]: uh oh
sartak [?\]: high level kibitzer
sartak [?\]: everyone act natural
LucasOman [?\]: eh
sartak [?\]: (hi Bbee :))
Violist [?\]: 2 dan!?
stumbly [?\]: /me puts pants on
Bbee [2d?\]: hi
Violist [?\]: man, I feel awkward
Bbee [2d?\]: ;)
sartak [?\]: aioli was 1k before he quit
Violist [?\]: wow...
stumbly [?\]: he was on tonight
sartak [?\]: jilles is 4-5k
Violist [?\]: I think jilles plays on another server that I play on
stumbly [?\]: amni = aioli
sartak [?\]: right
sartak [?\]: Lucas: you're up btw
]
;W[gc]C[stumbly [?\]: he left, can relax
sartak [?\]: whew
LucasOman [?\]: lol

;B[gf]C[Violist [?\]: thanks :)
stumbly [?\]: well yeah
sartak [?\]: rats
Violist [?\]: we may want to take those at D7 area now
stumbly [?\]: at least we're getting connected
Violist [?\]: running low on Freedoms
Violist [?\]: trie
sartak [?\]: you guys are lucky this is a turn-based game
Violist [?\]: I could totally click faster than you
LucasOman [?\]: hahah
sartak [?\]: bro
sartak [?\]: I've got intergo
stumbly [?\]: i thot it was interwhack
Arkrf21: bye and thanks
sartak [?\]: it fills the boards with my stones
sartak [?\]: and then removes them because they have no liberties
sartak [?\]: I don't have 2 eye logic yet :(
Violist [?\]: lol
stumbly [?\]: while (1) fap;
sartak [?\]: more or less
Violist [?\]: printf("Fap");
]
;W[dk]C[stumbly [?\]: it's in fap.h, duh
LucasOman [?\]: is our situation hopeless?
Violist [?\]: you fiend
sartak [?\]: has been for a while :/
Violist [?\]: trying to cut me off
]
;B[bk]C[sartak [?\]: but it's my fault too
LucasOman [?\]: i'm having a hard time figuring out what i should focus on
]
;W[ai]
;B[ek]C[sartak [?\]: nod
sartak [?\]: for now, cutting and connecting are probably enough to worry about
Violist [?\]: just play around, try to figure out the motives behind everyone's moves
Violist [?\]: (most moves have motives, but not all...
stumbly [?\]: doy went to sleep, that's soemthing
]
;W[kc]C[sartak [?\]: he has a life now or something
stumbly [?\]: shameful
doy [?\]: nah, just doing lots of reading
doy [?\]: school and all that
LucasOman [?\]: my wife is cooking a midnight snack for me
sartak [?\]: who is putting down this stone now? stu or vio?
LucasOman [?\]: i think that qualifies as "the life"
stumbly [?\]: fwiw, i think i like rengo
Violist [?\]: me
LucasOman [?\]: rather than "a life"
sartak [?\]: stumbly: yeah it's really nice
stumbly [?\]: viol to play

;B[dl]C[sartak [?\]: communication++
Violist [?\]: yeah, this is fun

LucasOman [?\]: is for horses

Violist [?\]: but
sartak [?\]: hehe
]
;B[eg]C[Violist [?\]: he'll see it on his own
sartak [?\]: ARGH
sartak [?\]: all vio's fault
LucasOman [?\]: what's violist's address
Violist [?\]: ...
LucasOman [?\]: i'm gonna send him anthrax
Violist [?\]: real life?
Violist [?\]: oh
stumbly [?\]: inside case
Violist [?\]: umm
sartak [?\]: I think he lives in atlantis
Violist [?\]: 1234 SE Main St., Small Town, Wisconsin
LucasOman [?\]: lol
Violist [?\]: er Minnesota
stumbly [?\]: oregon, they prefer anarchist attacks there
Violist [?\]: whichever one had the mail go down
sartak [?\]: one of those 'states'
Violist [?\]: y'know, there was a big headline around here
Violist [?\]: a recent marijuana bust
Violist [?\]: 8000 plants in one raid!
Violist [?\]: Apparently that's a new record :)
stumbly [?\]: rinky dink
]
;W[hi]C[sartak [?\]: look who's back up
]
;B[eh]
;W[ih]C[LucasOman [?\]: at a glance we don't look that bad off
Violist [?\]: man, that's going to be an annoying push into our territory
LucasOman [?\]: but upon further inspection
stumbly [?\]: thk
sartak [?\]: they will have a much easier time conquering the right side of the board
Violist [?\]: yeah... you guys can make a push for it but you'll have difficulty, especially if we cut you off from the main areas
]
;B[gh]C[Violist [?\]: there's enough space for eyes but it'll be hard
stumbly [?\]: lame but seemed safest
Violist [?\]: probably the best opeion
sartak [?\]: actually
sartak [?\]: it wasn't very helpful at all
sartak [?\]: your group is securely alive
sartak [?\]: the right side of the board is worth way more than 2 points
Violist [?\]: true...
stumbly [?\]: more a yose play, yeah
sartak [?\]: so while you saved yourself a point
sartak [?\]: I built up a bit more influence on the part that matters most
]
;W[hf]C[Violist [?\]: well
Violist [?\]: go and build it then
sartak [?\]: maybe I will!
Violist [?\]: Yeah, why don't you? :P
sartak [?\]: because it's black's turn
sartak [?\]: HINT HINT
LucasOman [?\]: hehe
]
;B[jh]
;W[ik]
;B[hk]C[Violist [?\]: rend and tear, little stones, rend and tear...
Violist [?\]: take them whities apart!
sartak [?\]: you know what hurts a lot
sartak [?\]: shale. right in the eye.
Violist [?\]: Yeah, that sounds painful
]
;W[kk]C[sartak [?\]: (1 point jump)++ :)
LucasOman [?\]: i mean, are you just ripping your eyeballs out every time i place a piece?
LucasOman [?\]: oh ok
LucasOman [?\]: haha
stumbly [?\]: so lucas, this is basically trying form eyes/tryig to deny eyes
sartak [?\]: well, we're understanding of your noobness
sartak [?\]: it's really ok
sartak [?\]: best we can do is hope to set a good example
]
;B[ii]C[LucasOman [?\]: yeh, look at this mess!
stumbly [?\]: yeah, not pretty
]
;W[ig]
;B[if]C[sartak [?\]: ok
Violist [?\]: odd move
sartak [?\]: our group there has only three liberties
sartak [?\]: and only one real mode of escape
Violist [?\]: I would have gone for K7
Violist [?\]: but now we have sente
sartak [?\]: I would have gone for H11
stumbly [?\]: h11 i can see
]
;W[hc]C[stumbly [?\]: i thot this helped the right side more
LucasOman [?\]: that's what i picked too!
sartak [?\]: :)
sartak [?\]: Lucas: interestingly, your opponent's best move is usually your own best move
stumbly [?\]: we're ahead, just need to secure the win
Violist [?\]: yeah, prevent them from placing stones in important places
LucasOman [?\]: that makes sense
]
;B[jk]C[sartak [?\]: so they have a pretty strong grip on the right side now
stumbly [?\]: now i have a bamboo joint and influence into the corner
sartak [?\]: we're pretty much done
Violist [?\]: I don't even remember what the bamboo joint is
LucasOman [?\]: bamboo joint? are you people just making these things up?
sartak [?\]: xx
sartak [?\]: ..
sartak [?\]: xx
sartak [?\]: nope
stumbly [?\]: look at jk 10/8
sartak [?\]: Go has names for everything!
stumbly [?\]: hard to attack, easy to connect
]
;W[ki]C[LucasOman [?\]: gotcha
]
;B[lb]C[sartak [?\]: if you play L7
sartak [?\]: they'll be forced to play K7
sartak [?\]: which doesn't help them all that much, I think
sartak [?\]: helps us more than it helps them
sartak [?\]: or they could ignore and let us connect up
]
;W[kg]C[LucasOman [?\]: either way we win
sartak [?\]: not really, but it helps :)
LucasOman [?\]: (the battle, not the war)
sartak [?\]: right
sartak [?\]: now _we_ have a good hold on the right side
sartak [?\]: and it'll be hard for them to wrest it out, since there's less space now
LucasOman [?\]: amber just set a gigantic bowl of peanut butter cookie dough in front of me
]
;B[jg]
;W[lf]C[sartak [?\]: did you show her Go yet ? :)
Violist [?\]: we should probably make some connections
]
;B[kh]C[Violist [?\]: that grouip is... vulnerable
LucasOman [?\]: a little, we haven't played together yet, though
sartak [?\]: nod
]
;W[lh]C[sartak [?\]: well it's looking better than I thought it would turn out
sartak [?\]: good move
LucasOman [?\]: :-D
stumbly [?\]: well, my late game is ass :p
]
;B[ji]C[Violist [?\]: yeah, I don't do late game well either
sartak [?\]: ha ha
sartak [?\]: my specialty!

;W[kj]C[LucasOman [?\]: i'm as good as the late game as the early game!
LucasOman [?\]: *grins*
Violist [?\]: bah, their invasion was pretty successful
Violist [?\]: we're not doing so hot anymore :|
sartak [?\]: you don't really see a late game on 9x9
Violist [?\]: guess we shoulda fortified
]
;B[kl]C[LucasOman [?\]: sartak: i just meant that i'm not really good at any of it yet :P

LucasOman [?\]: good move, sar, i was looking at that earlier
Violist [?\]: sorry stumbly >.>
sartak [?\]: I was hoping you'd blindly cap L7
Violist [?\]: Yeah, I was hoping we could get that before you guys did
LucasOman [?\]: his precious bamboo joint
Violist [?\]: L7?
Violist [?\]: what on earth for
sartak [?\]: FOR THE BLACK!!
Violist [?\]: M7? you mean?

Violist [?\]: Yeah
LucasOman [?\]: well i figured couldn't go wrong with blocking the outside AND getting a cut

sartak [?\]: but hey, you seem to be out of the "put stones in or around atari" phase and into the "looking ahead" phase. yay

LucasOman [?\]: sar lol thanks

LucasOman [?\]: yah
LucasOman [?\]: so is it worth it to capture?
stumbly [?\]: i'm definitely missing stuff i know better than
LucasOman [?\]: or if it's a sure thing, just leave it for now?
sartak [?\]: capture what? a8? no, it's way dead
sartak [?\]: defend against N11
]
;W[jb]C[sartak [?\]: \\o/
LucasOman [?\]: it was that or M13

LucasOman [?\]: huah

]
;B[md]C[sartak [?\]: N13 for great justice crap
Violist [?\]: N13 is a good freedom reducer
sartak [?\]: so there's really only one unsettled area now
LucasOman [?\]: but it's not necessary
sartak [?\]: H1 and thereabouts
LucasOman [?\]: they can go to N13 if they want
Violist [?\]: Yeah, good luck making eyes around H1
LucasOman [?\]: what about N7?
sartak [?\]: that'd be a ko fight
sartak [?\]: H1 is more worthwhile at this point
Violist [?\]: ko fights aren't really the most valuable things
Violist [?\]: but it's better than h1
Violist [?\]: (nah, lying, h1 is better)

sartak [?\]: Lucas: we can try it
stumbly [?\]: yeah sry viol, multitasking
sartak [?\]: not right now though

;W[mg]C[sartak [?\]: we could try to fight for killing G1b
stumbly [?\]: close game in the end
sartak [?\]: ut it's incredibly unlikely they'll misstep
stumbly [?\]: our bad
sartak [?\]: so much so that it's an insult to them if we attempt it
Violist [?\]: hehe
Violist [?\]: Game done?
LucasOman [?\]: hehe
sartak [?\]: I disagree that that boy's dead
stumbly [?\]: lower right?

Violist [?\]: damn
Violist [?\]: we got pwnt
Violist [?\]: nice invasion
sartak [?\]: yay Lucas! :D
stumbly [?\]: yeah, maybe ko fight but good comeback guys
LucasOman [?\]: wow
LucasOman [?\]: gj sartak
stumbly [?\]: :)
stumbly [?\]: well, good game all :)
Violist [?\]: yeah!
Violist [?\]: I got time for a 1v1 if someone's interested
LucasOman [?\]: i keep wondering why i've never played this game before
Violist [?\]: else I've got a load of homework and no sleep in a long time
sartak [?\]: before we close up
stumbly [?\]: i'm done for the moment, not concentrating obv
sartak [?\]: notice how J11, N13, L13, and N6 have no points
sartak [?\]: those are called "dame"
sartak [?\]: which means they belong to no one
sartak [?\]: so no one gets points for them
LucasOman [?\]: i see..
sartak [?\]: and filling them in doesn't help pointwise, since you don't get points for filled in spots
sartak [?\]: shrug, just pointing that out :)
Violist [?\]: frequently people fill them in at the end of the game
Violist [?\]: just as the last series of moves
Violist [?\]: (convenience's sake when scoring IRL)
sartak [?\]: so L13 is owned by no one because
sartak [?\]: if black plays N13, then we have to play L13
LucasOman [?\]: so it's a wash
sartak [?\]: shrug, it kinda makes sense if you squint :)
sartak [?\]: I'd love to play more but I have work in the morn
sartak [?\]: so, good night, have fun, thanks!
Violist [?\]: ah, pity
Violist [?\]: yeah, thanks :)
LucasOman [?\]: yeh thanks guys
LucasOman [?\]: this was great
Violist [?\]: poke me if you ever want a game
