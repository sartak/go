Dragnox [?\]: Hi
sartak [17k\]: You say you know the basics right?
Dragnox [?\]: Yeah. I thinjk so.
sartak [17k\]: ok well I'll just run through them
sartak [17k\]: the object of the game is to surround as much territory as possible
sartak [17k\]: I'll give you four free stones
]RE[B+Resign]
(;B[gc]C[sartak [17k\]: a stone has four liberties
sartak [17k\]: well
sartak [17k\]: This stone has four liberties

sartak [17k\]: black would ordinarily be able to recapture by playing at the square (C2)
sartak [17k\]: but the rule of ko forbids it

Dragnox [?\]: rofl
Dragnox [?\]: I read about that.
sartak [17k\]: so in this situation black has to play somewhere else

;B[fe]C[sartak [17k\]: now white responds

;W[cg]C[Dragnox [?\]: I'm not sure I get it.
sartak [17k\]: Ko just forbids the repetition of board state
sartak [17k\]: because otherwise you could just keep going through it forever
Dragnox [?\]: Uh-huh...
sartak [17k\]: So what don't you get? :)
Dragnox [?\]: Hmm
]
;B[eh]
;W[eg]C[Dragnox [?\]: So if black goes to C2 it's okay if he waits a turn?
sartak [17k\]: yeah
sartak [17k\]: But usually white will play something black _has_ to respond to
sartak [17k\]: so black will spend his turn responding instead of recapturing that one stone
sartak [17k\]: Such a move by white is called a ko threat
Dragnox [?\]: But white can't go back to C3 without waiting a turn?
]
;B[ch]C[Dragnox [?\]: Because you don't want to encourage doing the same shit repeatedly?
sartak [17k\]: yeah
Dragnox [?\]: kk
sartak [17k\]: Because otherwise if it's a close game the players might be in dispute about this one stone forever
sartak [17k\]: so ko solves that
amni [1k\]: without the ko rule a _lot_ of games would end with that
sartak [17k\]: it also adds strategery
sartak [17k\]: with ko threats
sartak [17k\]: so yeah
sartak [17k\]: Let's try playing
