sartak [11k?\]: :)

;B[he]C[HanClinto [?\]: Almost didn't see it
HanClinto [?\]: Sheesh
stumbly [21k?\]:  i liked e4
HanClinto [?\]: The number of times you've gotten me on that kind of atari.
sartak [11k?\]: was wondering why you were taking so long
sartak [11k?\]: it's an easy move to make! :)
HanClinto [?\]: I honestly didn't see it (like usual)

;W[gc]C[sartak [11k?\]: Cuts and connections man
amni [1k\]: black can play it safe and do f7
stumbly [21k?\]: seems like black is in shit tho

(;B[ef]C[amni [1k\]: not at all
]
;W[df]C[amni [1k\]: ahead by an enormous amount
amni [1k\]: but black e4 just now lost many points
stumbly [21k?\]: interesting, ok
amni [1k\]: well e4 lose points too
sartak [11k?\]: What should he have played instead?
amni [1k\]: instead of e4, f7

amni [1k\]: not now

;W[hd]C[amni [1k\]: g8 was a bad move
stumbly [21k?\]: seems like white gained a lot 
]
;B[id]
;W[fd]C[amni [1k\]: simply e6 or f7 instead of e4
amni [1k\]: and white has nothing

sartak [11k?\]: hmm
amni [1k\]: this ko is bad for black
sartak [11k?\]: Fine!
HanClinto [?\]: Hrm.
HanClinto [?\]: Which one to take....
stumbly [21k?\]: ko fight!

;B[ec]C[sartak [11k?\]: :/
amni [1k\]: yeah, black just c9 and is ok
sartak [11k?\]: I can take it back after a ko threat
sartak [11k?\]: The other one would've been much better
HanClinto [?\]: We'll ask Aoili. :)
HanClinto [?\]: Aioli

;W[cb]
;B[dd]C[amni [1k\]: now black is in the lead again
HanClinto [?\]: I took the one I did so that I could do that

;W[ca]
;B[bb]C[sartak [11k?\]: if you say so :)
stumbly [21k?\]: seems like white should solidify
HanClinto [?\]: *shrug*
sartak [11k?\]: but yeah I'm playing poorly now
sartak [11k?\]: :/
]
;W[bd]
;B[ba]C[amni [1k\]: you can shift-click on g8 to go when g8 was played
]
;W[ac]C[amni [1k\]: b9 is unnecessary and should be e2, which is a very big move
]
;B[cd]C[stumbly [21k?\]: yeah
]
;W[be]C[stumbly [21k?\]: white had dominance on a lot of territory
stumbly [21k?\]: going away
]
;B[eh]
;W[dh]
;B[bg]C[stumbly [21k?\]: pretty much over now
amni [1k\]: now white e1
amni [1k\]: because black should have played d1.

;W[]C[HanClinto [?\]: I didn't want you to take C9 -- that might have been able to break the eye
HanClinto [?\]: Hrm.
HanClinto [?\]: I see no reason for me to pass
HanClinto [?\]: I'm still attacking in the lower-left.
sartak [11k?\]: Do you expect to sustain life there?
HanClinto [?\]: Lemme' check...
sartak [11k?\]: We can play it out.
HanClinto [?\]: Hrm. No, I wouldn't get life there

HanClinto [?\]: Very welcome!
HanClinto [?\]: Yeah, I felt like I was winning.

sartak [11k?\]: true
amni [1k\]: and play b6

sartak [11k?\]: If white F9 then black E9
amni [1k\]: no
amni [1k\]: if white f9 then black ignores that too
