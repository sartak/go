sartak [16k\]: OK

sartak [16k\]: The object of the game is to surround as much territory as you can
sartak [16k\]: players take turns placing stones, you've probably gleaned that much :)
doy: yeah

sartak [16k\]: Normally stones have four liberties
doy: okay
sartak [16k\]: adjacent stones of one color are connected

sartak [16k\]: because you'd be playing some tones in your own territory
sartak [16k\]: I marked that white stone as dead
sartak [16k\]: Each side's score is simply captures + the smaller stones (= controlled territory)
sartak [16k\]: you get no points for stones of your color on the board
sartak [16k\]: So playing in your own territory decreases your score
