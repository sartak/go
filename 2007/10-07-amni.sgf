;W[nc]C[amni [-\]: pass an enjoyable sporting engagement

;B[qf]
;W[fc]C[sartak [?\]: we who are about to die salute you
]
;B[cf]
;W[jd]
;B[hd]C[amni [-\]: yeah, i don't have much to say, just in general don't worry about capturing unimportant / practically-dead stones
sartak [?\]: nod
amni [-\]: and be careful about adding more stones to a group that is already weak
amni [-\]: because you can make it heavy
sartak [?\]: I don't quite grok the difference between heavy and thick
amni [-\]: heavy means burdensome
sartak [?\]: except that heavy is bad and thick is good?
sartak [?\]: ok
jilles [3k?\]: heavy means it's too many stones to give away, and hard to make 2 eyes
amni [-\]: thick means hard to attack
]
;W[fe]C[sartak [?\]: I wonder if I'm good enough to start learning joseki
sartak [?\]: because I am totally not sure how ot respond :)
amni [-\]: in my opinion, everyone is
]
;B[qn]C[amni [-\]: you just have to be careful how you use what you learn
]
;W[dm]C[sartak [?\]:  right. the whole "learning joseki costs you 2 stones" thing
]
;B[fq]C[amni [-\]: sort of like when learning that pressing the Z button throws people in smash bros melee made me lose 17 million times in a row
]
;W[dg]C[sartak [?\]: :D
sartak [?\]: I played about 5 games of ssbm before I learned how to smash
sartak [?\]: I.. wasn't good!
]
;B[ch]C[amni [-\]: i didn't learn about the c stick smash until after i had been playing for years
]
;W[cg]
;B[bg]C[sartak [?\]: nod
]
;W[bh]C[sartak [?\]: my instinct is B11

]
;W[op]C[sartak [?\]: he's viciously critical
]
;B[oo]C[amni [-\]: oh, you don't have to tell me :(
]
;W[np]C[sartak [?\]: ok
sartak [?\]: so here I feel like I'm losing again :D
amni [-\]: nah
sartak [?\]: so I'm just going to focus on getting the corner
amni [-\]: the upper left cost me like 40 points
amni [-\]: maybe more
amni [-\]: so you have a safe and maintainable lead
]
;B[mo]
(;W[no]C[amni [-\]: O2 could be called heavy as well
amni [-\]: it hurts to lose that liberty in the long run
]
;B[nn]C[amni [-\]: this cut was probably bad (N6) but it starts trouble at least
]
;W[mn]
(;B[mp]
;W[on]
;B[po]
;W[nm]TR[mo][mp][nq]C[amni [-\]: now those stones are a little dead
sartak [?\]: nod
amni [-\]: they can escape but they'll be weak
amni [-\]: and probably lose points in the process
amni [-\]: so it's best not to add to them until you know you can do it right
amni [-\]: if you do escape
amni [-\]: play out first
]
(;B[nr]C[amni [-\]: that oversightcost you a lot of points though
sartak [?\]: O2?
]
;W[ko]C[amni [-\]: your response to N6
amni [-\]: connecting at P6 would have been fine for you
amni [-\]: or
]
;B[lq]C[amni [-\]: well, yeah, i guess you need to connect to prevent Q5 shenanigans
]
;W[kr]C[sartak [?\]: I always want to poke in with L4
sartak [?\]: but that just helps you
]
;B[or]C[amni [-\]: whenever you do a move like that it gives me two cutting points
amni [-\]: but it also costs you a liberty
amni [-\]: like my o5 was that type of move
amni [-\]: except o5 was sente at least
amni [-\]: sente-ish
amni [-\]: whereas L4 is definitely gote
]
;W[pq]
;B[qr]C[amni [-\]: the liberty that o5 cost was pricey
]
;W[ps]
;B[eb]
;W[qh]C[sartak [?\]: sente is hard
amni [-\]: hard like a fox
]
;B[oh]
;W[pg]
;B[of]
;W[qj]C[amni [-\]: but i think r9 is fiercer, personally
]
(;B[ql]C[sartak [?\]: I think I'm doing OK here
amni [-\]: r8 is too loose
amni [-\]: but i liked p14
sartak [?\]: :)
amni [-\]: R8 could be R9 I think
sartak [?\]: cool

amni [-\]: which, though they cut
amni [-\]: well, i dunno

amni [-\]: I hope it's "TITANIC SINKS hundreds lose lives"
sartak [?\]: haha
]
;B[eg]LB[he:A][lg:B][mg:hvy][nq:C]C[sartak [?\]: so
jilles [3k?\]: you described a bamboo shape there?
sartak [?\]: A and B are probably heavy
sartak [?\]: C isn't
amni [-\]: B is dead
amni [-\]: as is C
sartak [?\]: yes
sartak [?\]: I'm throwing A's lot in with B
amni [-\]: but dead stones are no burden
sartak [?\]: ah
amni [-\]: in fact they may have aji
amni [-\]: or ko threats
amni [-\]: which can be useful
sartak [?\]: so. A is definitely heavy. too many stones to just give up
amni [-\]: of course it's still usually bad to let large groups die
amni [-\]: N13 was a canonical heavy move
amni [-\]: heh
]
;W[fg]C[sartak [?\]: bah
sartak [?\]: you're supposed to blindly try to save your stones !
amni [-\]: i have considered those two stones expendable for a long time
]
;B[dh]C[sartak [?\]: you make me a sad panda
amni [-\]: you don't need to capture them
amni [-\]: because i won't save them
sartak [?\]: lies !
amni [-\]: it's a true
sartak [?\]: :)
]
;W[en]C[sartak [?\]: so let's evaluate the state of the game
sartak [?\]: I probably have the bottom right, barring unforeseen awesomenes
sartak [?\]: that might be worth 30 points
amni [-\]: yeah
amni [-\]: not that much
sartak [?\]: right
sartak [?\]: 20
amni [-\]: no
sartak [?\]: 10!
amni [-\]: not more than 15
sartak [?\]: ok :)
amni [-\]: welll
sartak [?\]: I also have a shaky grip on the top left
amni [-\]: okay maybe 20, depending on how clever you are
amni [-\]: your top left is solid and big
sartak [?\]: I just don't like my position at all. that killing in the top middle hurts :)
sartak [?\]: so at this point I'd resign
amni [-\]: you may if you want
sartak [?\]: ok :)
sartak [?\]: hehe
sartak [?\]: thank you sir
amni [-\]: then i'l get to see all of jilles's badmouthing behind the scenes
sartak [?\]: I think I'm learning
amni [-\]: *waits for it
sartak [?\]: he waits until after the game
amni [-\]: thank you for the game
jilles [3k?\]: don't have too much to comment on it
sartak [?\]: then he bombards every medium you share with him with scathing criticism
amni [-\]: heh
sartak [?\]: see, there he goes
sartak [?\]: :)

(;B[qk]C[sartak [?\]: the next few moves did illustrate exactly why R8 was too loose
amni [-\]: yeah
sartak [?\]: what can white do here? other than tenuki :)
sartak [?\]: if anything
amni [-\]: well
amni [-\]: can try Q11 anyway
]
;W[pi]C[amni [-\]: and then black P10
amni [-\]: maybe?
amni [-\]: yeah, O10 is a bad response
amni [-\]: P11 is the first thing you always consider
]
(;B[oj]C[sartak [?\]: I was tthinking O10
amni [-\]: then white, at the very least, has a ko at S9
sartak [?\]: but that offers the cut
amni [-\]: but here it leads to easy life for white
jilles [3k?\]: downside of r9 is that it's next to a stone you want to attack
amni [-\]: you could consider q9 instead of r9

amni [-\]: nah
amni [-\]: too anxiety-provoking
jilles [3k?\]: too late in the night
