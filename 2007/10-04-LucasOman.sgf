Arkrf21: well i have troubles beginnig my game..
sartak [?\]: me too :)
Arkrf21: so i want to request some tips
sartak [?\]: so the first move is usually in the corner

sartak [?\]: otherwise we could go back and forth infinitely

sartak [?\]: nope
LucasOman [?\]: oh right
sartak [?\]: you're thinking of suicide while capturing

;W[gh]C[sartak [?\]: so your group is going to die, because there's no real place to make a second eye

;B[bg]C[sartak [?\]: you can try though

;W[ag]C[LucasOman [?\]: damn ataris
sartak [?\]: :D

;B[ei]
;W[ci]C[sartak [?\]: it may look like you have an eye down here
sartak [?\]: but you don't
LucasOman [?\]: oh shicrap
sartak [?\]: because I can safely fill it in
sartak [?\]: :)
sartak [?\]: yeah, if you got C1 then that would have been an eye at D1
sartak [?\]: but I still would've won simply because I have way more open territory
LucasOman [?\]: define "eye"
]
;B[ih]C[sartak [?\]: it's somewhat subtle
sartak [?\]: so an eye is a hole in your group, intuitively
sartak [?\]: the stones surrounding an eye must be in a group
sartak [?\]: OR very strongly connectable

;B[hh]C[sartak [?\]: such that for any move I make, you can connect

sartak [?\]: Ark: I'm going to teach some stuff

sartak [?\]: ok
sartak [?\]: 4/8 and 5/7 are symmetrical

LucasOman [?\]: yah

LucasOman [?\]: yah

LucasOman [?\]: F6

(;B[fd]C[sartak [?\]: white has only one escape plan, since he's in atari

sartak [?\]: well
sartak [?\]: your goal is to capture F4
LucasOman [?\]: seems like connecting can be a two edged sword
LucasOman [?\]: oh ok
sartak [?\]: neither of your groups is in danger of being captured
LucasOman [?\]: same goal
sartak [?\]: so D4 or D5 again?
LucasOman [?\]: in this case you want to prevent F4 from connecting
sartak [?\]: yep
LucasOman [?\]: so F6 or D4
sartak [?\]: you're exactly right though
sartak [?\]: E5 is the right move

sartak [?\]: :)

sartak [?\]: yep
LucasOman [?\]: ok, so should have done E5 first
LucasOman [?\]: then cut you off either up or down if attempting to connect
LucasOman [?\]: F6 was a premature move, E5 wasnt
sartak [?\]: that's an example of a strongly connectable
sartak [?\]: you can do nothing to stop the connection

sartak [?\]: connection dies at midnight for a minute..

(;B[ee]C[sartak [?\]: this move
LucasOman [?\]: or black's strategy?

sartak [?\]: ah right

;B[df]
;W[fe]
;B[fd]C[LucasOman [?\]: sweet
sartak [?\]: E5 is called a "net"
LucasOman [?\]: what white had?

(;B[ig]
;W[ih]
;AW[dd][hg][hh]AB[gh][ih][gi][hi]C[sartak [?\]: so it's black's move
sartak [?\]: he may not recognize this pattern
sartak [?\]: so you can dump the stone at D6
sartak [?\]: which may or may not be tactically significant in the vicinity of D6
sartak [?\]: the D6 stone here is called a ladder breaker

;B[de]
;W[ed]C[sartak [?\]: uh oh
sartak [?\]: white now has a lot of liberties
sartak [?\]: so black tries some damage control
LucasOman [?\]: white's basically one move ahead

;W[ii]
;B[if]
;W[ie]C[sartak [?\]: good thought
LucasOman [?\]: well, it would have to already have been seeded
LucasOman [?\]: since you couldn't waste a move seeding
sartak [?\]: you could if the other player doesn't realize there's a ladder lurking near
LucasOman [?\]: because you're in a constant state of atari
LucasOman [?\]: yeh

;B[cf]C[sartak [?\]: good :)

sartak [?\]: :)
LucasOman [?\]: yar
sartak [?\]: want an undo?
LucasOman [?\]: eh
LucasOman [?\]: nah
sartak [?\]: k
sartak [?\]: so there's an interesting aspect of Go in that there's a very sane and intuitive rating system
sartak [?\]: there's kyu and dan=
sartak [?\]: dan
]
;B[bf]C[sartak [?\]: there are roughly 30 levels of kyu, and 7-9 dan (I forget how many)
sartak [?\]: say you have a 30-kyu player and a 29-kyu player
]
;W[df]C[sartak [?\]: if the 30-kyu player is given a 1 stone handicap
sartak [?\]: then the probability he'll win is about 50%
sartak [?\]: so the rating is defined by handicap
sartak [?\]: it's a little fuzzy, but that's the general idea
LucasOman [?\]: ok
sartak [?\]: decreasing kyu is good, increasing dan is good
sartak [?\]: so you're probably at the 25 kyu level
sartak [?\]: I'm probably about 20 right now
