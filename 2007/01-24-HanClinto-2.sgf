HanClinto [?\]: I wanted you to join at E9 rather than E8
sartak [16k\]: o rly
HanClinto [?\]: So I played E8, and forced you to join at E9, and I just lost a stone, but not a turn.
sartak [16k\]: you did lose sente, since I could ignore E8
sartak [16k\]: but sente this late doesn't help much
HanClinto [?\]: sente is what again?
sartak [16k\]: initiative
jilles [6k\]: too greedy again, eh :P
HanClinto [?\]: Ah
HanClinto [?\]: If I play G1, then you play H1
HanClinto [?\]: And then I have to play G2 to save G1
sartak [16k\]: shrug :)
sartak [16k\]: we do have to resolve it for kgs
HanClinto [?\]: But if I want to block you, then I play G2, which means I wind up playing that stone anyways

;B[gi]C[HanClinto [?\]: So I might as well do it this way even though I knowingly put myself into a brief atary

sartak [16k\]: yeah, it's over man :)
HanClinto [?\]: Oh, my bad.
HanClinto [?\]: I didn't see if you had passed
sartak [16k\]: I didn't last turn
HanClinto [?\]: Oh okay
sartak [16k\]: I was hoping you'd notice it was over
HanClinto [?\]: Well you know me, I battle it out to the bitter end. :)
HanClinto [?\]: If it were up to me, the board would be full of stones or eyes, and the carnage would be vast and rampant.
sartak [16k\]: you'll hopefully lose that habit :)
