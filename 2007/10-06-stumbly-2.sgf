;W[dp]C[stumbly [?\]: ok make me pick
sartak [?\]: :)
]
;B[mq]C[sartak [?\]: I always play the corners if I can
sartak [?\]: I think that move is good. the usual move is keima though
stumbly [?\]: ya
sartak [?\]: (knight's move)
]
;W[fq]
;B[nc]
;W[qf]C[stumbly [?\]: fighty
sartak [?\]: :)

(;B[pf]C[sartak [?\]: I don't know joseki at all. can't say what the right response is
stumbly [?\]: yeah me either
sartak [?\]: I think R11 or so is a pincer, which is good
sartak [?\]: Q14 wasn't good
sartak [?\]: too slow
stumbly [?\]: ok here's a decision point
sartak [?\]: Q10 is better
sartak [?\]: ah right
sartak [?\]: here's where I said pincer I think
stumbly [?\]: yeah, i think you wre right
]
;W[qh]C[stumbly [?\]: yeah
sartak [?\]: so here I want an escape route
]
;B[pj]C[stumbly [?\]: just trying to connect a bit
sartak [?\]: hmm
sartak [?\]: right
sartak [?\]: well, I'll make it interesting
]
;W[qn]
;B[jd]C[stumbly [?\]: i think i'm behind here
sartak [?\]: hmm
stumbly [?\]: despite some connections/moyo
sartak [?\]: yeah you did kind of spend too much on the right side
]
;W[gc]
;B[hd]
;W[ge]C[stumbly [?\]: no real logic here, just feel
sartak [?\]: aye
]
;B[gd]C[stumbly [?\]: i'm a little pushed into the center now, which makes me nervoous
sartak [?\]: you have moyo
sartak [?\]: the potential to make territory
stumbly [?\]: yep
sartak [?\]: while I have a good stake on territory on the right wall
sartak [?\]: thinking about this G16 move
sartak [?\]: you can certainly get away with it, since you have a lot of support
sartak [?\]: hane!
]
;W[fd]C[stumbly [?\]: i think i ignore it and expand
sartak [?\]: yeah
sartak [?\]: so the next move here is probably D10
sartak [?\]: stake out the last big piece of territory
stumbly [?\]: dunno, or more connect?
sartak [?\]: which?
stumbly [?\]: like hrm
stumbly [?\]: ok this i recall
sartak [?\]: my point was ultimately that tengen is a bad play :)
sartak [?\]: for either side
stumbly [?\]: yeah maybe
sartak [?\]: center comes last usually
stumbly [?\]: well
stumbly [?\]: what here
stumbly [?\]: black is thin
sartak [?\]: R8?
stumbly [?\]: kind of invites white to pwn the left side
sartak [?\]: so the problem occurred earlier in the game
stumbly [?\]: could be!
sartak [?\]: since black is already at a disadvantage
stumbly [?\]: i think wasting a stone on g16 was proly wrong
sartak [?\]: yeah but I think we spent an equal number of stones
stumbly [?\]: better to fight first white stone on right side
stumbly [?\]: but well, i lose fights!
sartak [?\]: that's where goproblems excels
stumbly [?\]: misclick
stumbly [?\]: well
]
(;B[om]C[sartak [?\]: remember that the ultimate goal of the game is to make territory
sartak [?\]: ok
sartak [?\]: well
stumbly [?\]: d10 seemed a little overplayiish
stumbly [?\]: yeah
stumbly [?\]: hrm
]
;W[dj]C[sartak [?\]: :)
stumbly [?\]: if i could fight i would try a corner now
sartak [?\]: so I feel like I might just give up the right wall if I can push you against it
stumbly [?\]: proly c17
sartak [?\]: by playing tengen or so
sartak [?\]: C17 is probably too aggressive
stumbly [?\]: for me it is
stumbly [?\]: well, and c3 is possible
stumbly [?\]: but.... i lose those fights
]
;B[qm]C[sartak [?\]: nod
]
;W[jj]
;B[ji]C[sartak [?\]: tengen is probably a bad move
sartak [?\]: since it doesn't do anything by itself
sartak [?\]: just kinda sits there waiting for action
]
;W[jq]C[stumbly [?\]: i figure i can expand this fight into support
]
;B[kp]
;W[kr]C[stumbly [?\]: (dont know, just feels that way)
sartak [?\]: there's a proverb
sartak [?\]: "don't play on the second line in the early game"
sartak [?\]: but oh well
sartak [?\]: here it feels necessary
stumbly [?\]: not sure if i shd ignore that
sartak [?\]: hm
sartak [?\]: if you ignore it I might shiv you with N2
stumbly [?\]: seems like money is around g13
sartak [?\]: g13 looks valuable
stumbly [?\]: you have all the edges tho
sartak [?\]: my grip on the right is tenuous at best
stumbly [?\]: sorta
stumbly [?\]: y
sartak [?\]: especially with R7 sitting there
stumbly [?\]: well, that's cuz i'm so smaert
sartak [?\]: hehe
]
;B[jn]C[sartak [?\]: well like I said, I'll let you have the right side if it wins me the rest of the board
sartak [?\]: hm
sartak [?\]: ok
]
;W[mr]C[stumbly [?\]: not sure here
sartak [?\]: K6 is a fine move
]
;B[nq]C[stumbly [?\]: compress you to 2nd line maybe
sartak [?\]: O2 would be a bad play for me
sartak [?\]: since it is small territory for me and a lot of influence for oyu
stumbly [?\]: well, q4 supports my last move
sartak [?\]: so I'll try a cut
]
;W[lp]C[sartak [?\]: hm
sartak [?\]: not liking the cut :)
stumbly [?\]: m3 feels right but not sure
sartak [?\]: but then you respond with M4
stumbly [?\]: i meant me
sartak [?\]: and it's back to the little territory vs a lot of influence
sartak [?\]: ah ok
stumbly [?\]: deny connection, etc
]
;B[lq]
;W[lo]C[sartak [?\]: so the cut.. not so much :)
stumbly [?\]: well
stumbly [?\]: i feel like you're kind of scattered
stumbly [?\]: not sure how best to proceed
stumbly [?\]: h4 comes to mind
sartak [?\]: hmm
stumbly [?\]: or maybe anchor the corner with like... O6
sartak [?\]: I can block a bit with K4 or so
stumbly [?\]: let's run the wall a bit
]
;B[ko]C[sartak [?\]: intuition tells me to hane
stumbly [?\]: dont know hane
sartak [?\]: hane is when you play at the head of your opponent's group
sartak [?\]: so here a hane would be L6
stumbly [?\]: hrm
stumbly [?\]: doesnt seem best to me
sartak [?\]: right
stumbly [?\]: your M4 is stranded and i can expand left
sartak [?\]: M6 would cut, atari, and seriously endanger M5
sartak [?\]: so. I'll step out a bit further
stumbly [?\]: try to undermine/invade
stumbly [?\]: but can't concede whole left half either
]
(;W[qq]C[sartak [?\]: riight
stumbly [?\]: yeah
sartak [?\]: I mean
sartak [?\]: right
sartak [?\]: :)
stumbly [?\]: this is around where the key is
sartak [?\]: I think you did concede the whole left half when you played O7 instead of D10
stumbly [?\]: hrm?
stumbly [?\]: i didnt play o7
sartak [?\]: er, P7
]
;B[pq]C[sartak [?\]: hm. yeah I'm not a fan of it
stumbly [?\]: ok
]
;W[pr]C[stumbly [?\]: go back
stumbly [?\]: heh
sartak [?\]: o
sartak [?\]: k
])
(;W[ln]C[stumbly [?\]: what about R3?
sartak [?\]: for whom?
stumbly [?\]: u
sartak [?\]: we can try it
stumbly [?\]: welp
stumbly [?\]: i want to work some connection here
sartak [?\]: if I were invading I'd go in with P2 or so
sartak [?\]: which I may try after this is settled a bit
stumbly [?\]: n7?
stumbly [?\]: want to limit this group and expand
sartak [?\]: n7 looks good
]
;B[mm]C[sartak [?\]: so if I play M8 you play M7
sartak [?\]: let's just play it out actually
sartak [?\]: hehe
sartak [?\]: retcon
stumbly [?\]: can you honestly threaten the corner from here?
]
(;W[ll]
;B[lm]
;W[km]C[stumbly [?\]: ill try ur line
sartak [?\]: ok, L6 would squash
stumbly [?\]: better than l3?
stumbly [?\]: guess so
stumbly [?\]: cuts you up more
sartak [?\]: yeah
sartak [?\]: it kills M5
sartak [?\]: in its tracks
sartak [?\]: classic crane in the nest
stumbly [?\]: yeah but my moyo is rapidly becoming a shack
sartak [?\]: not to mention that you can just ignore it for a while, you have all these stones
sartak [?\]: hehe
sartak [?\]: actually
sartak [?\]: you have a good luck on the lower right
sartak [?\]: lock*
sartak [?\]: I'd have a tough time invading to any degree of success
stumbly [?\]: well, i need to win the right side

stumbly [?\]: you have control
sartak [?\]: ah sorry
sartak [?\]: k
]
;B[qq]C[stumbly [?\]: i'm guessing here
sartak [?\]: nod
stumbly [?\]: i want to back up the corner and also connect out
sartak [?\]: I feel O2 might be a good first block
stumbly [?\]: yeah, thot of that too
sartak [?\]: we'll see how R3 works though
]
;W[qr]C[sartak [?\]: Lucas is around
stumbly [?\]: im tempted to go after r6
]
(;B[pr]C[sartak [?\]: well
sartak [?\]: I meant cut R6 from my invaders
sartak [?\]: by playing close to the invasion
sartak [?\]: but that works too
sartak [?\]: tiger's mouth
]
;W[ps]
;B[pq]C[sartak [?\]: so here is a common pattern
stumbly [?\]: k
sartak [?\]: I want to play R1 to make sure I can sustain the invasion
sartak [?\]: but you can still squelch it
]
;W[qs]C[sartak [?\]: by playing S2
]
;B[rr]C[stumbly [?\]: well yeah, you just backfill libs
sartak [?\]: yep
sartak [?\]: there's a hole here that I can try to exploit

stumbly [?\]: hehe
sartak [?\]: :)
sartak [?\]: want to backtrack at all?
stumbly [?\]: anything is ok
sartak [?\]: ok, let's see if there's anything I can do to make it go better
stumbly [?\]: not playing to win, playing to have fun :p

(;W[rs]C[sartak [?\]: so try this out
sartak [?\]: I think it leaves my stones intact

;W[os]

;W[ns]C[stumbly [?\]: yeah better

;W[ls]
;B[ss]C[sartak [?\]: so anyway, looks like being overgreedy didn't work for me

;B[lr]
;W[ks]C[stumbly [?\]: thar
stumbly [?\]: well, just making you fill in
stumbly [?\]: but they survive
sartak [?\]: your N3 group is low on liberties, I might try to trick you into losing it
stumbly [?\]: yep
sartak [?\]: if I can somehow justify L3
stumbly [?\]: i was just playin it out
sartak [?\]: so maybe K4
stumbly [?\]: dont know the tesuji
sartak [?\]: (me play K4)
]
;B[jp]C[sartak [?\]: well
sartak [?\]: would you play that? probably, to try to corral me in
sartak [?\]: so I want to escape
]
;W[hq]C[stumbly [?\]: well, i still want to kill m5
sartak [?\]: nod
sartak [?\]: I've given up on it
sartak [?\]: if I can devel around L9 then I might try to save it
stumbly [?\]: but l3 is a cheap way to conect
]
;B[kq]C[sartak [?\]: ok
sartak [?\]: so now I can play somewhere else
stumbly [?\]: i'm not bulletproof, but lots of libs
sartak [?\]: L1 is pretty secure
sartak [?\]: so something like this feels right
]
;W[hl]C[sartak [?\]: and finally makes tengen useful
stumbly [?\]: yeah

;W[rr]
;B[jr]C[sartak [?\]: nice
sartak [?\]: hmmm
sartak [?\]: well let's examine my options
sartak [?\]: J3 but that will not end well
stumbly [?\]: save the stone by connecting
stumbly [?\]: counterattack elsewhere
sartak [?\]: J2 but you can just capture
sartak [?\]: there's this
]
;W[ro]TR[ib][lb][ob][rd][kg][mj]C[sartak [?\]: which buys me a liberty or three :)
sartak [?\]: so hmm
sartak [?\]: I think your best option
sartak [?\]: well
sartak [?\]: this move was good :)
stumbly [?\]: yeah
stumbly [?\]: also, black is screwed everywhere else
stumbly [?\]: ie, me
sartak [?\]: nah
stumbly [?\]: well, not dead, but wont win
sartak [?\]: you have all this
stumbly [?\]: you might save r12
stumbly [?\]: after the corner
sartak [?\]: so you cut
sartak [?\]: you have plenty of influence
stumbly [?\]: pressure from all  sides on black
stumbly [?\]: well, ok, smaller loss
stumbly [?\]: but black is way behind
sartak [?\]: hmm
stumbly [?\]: looks that way to me
]
(;B[iq]C[sartak [?\]: yes
sartak [?\]: is to continue the assault over there
stumbly [?\]: your stones are kinda feelin vuolnerable
sartak [?\]: and then after you cut me
sartak [?\]: scoop me in
stumbly [?\]: i think the game swung earlier
sartak [?\]: remember this one?
sartak [?\]: :)
stumbly [?\]: hrm

stumbly [?\]: proly

stumbly [?\]: you're not alive yet
sartak [?\]: right
sartak [?\]: S4 is not an eye
sartak [?\]: T5 will likely become my second eye if you can't kill
stumbly [?\]: but if you get t5, i'm done
