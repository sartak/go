sartak [18k\]: hmm
sartak [18k\]: Though I guess you could tell if you wanted by looking at the game with the VCR like buttons

;W[ff]C[sartak [18k\]: Got greedy :)
jasonmay [?\]: eyes :(
sartak [18k\]: nah they're false eyes
jasonmay [?\]: oh right
jasonmay [?\]: or are you tricking me again :P
sartak [18k\]: No, I'm being honest :)
sartak [18k\]: The way to tell is: can you capture them if I repeatedly pass?
sartak [18k\]: Start by capturing, say, E3
jasonmay [?\]: no, you really can't
jasonmay [?\]: not that I can see
jasonmay [?\]: because of the other eye
sartak [18k\]: F3, E2, E3
sartak [18k\]: The D5
sartak [18k\]: then*
sartak [18k\]: The stones aren't connected
jasonmay [?\]: the D5 is what would keep me from putting something in E4
sartak [18k\]: You can put something in E4 since it's not suicide: E4 captures E3
sartak [18k\]: if you have F3 and E2
jasonmay [?\]: but I'm surrounded, I can't put somethign there in the first place
jasonmay [?\]: unless you fill up D5 right after
sartak [18k\]: You can
sartak [18k\]: It's not suicide since you're capturing E3
jasonmay [?\]: I can't cap E3 though
sartak [18k\]: If I pass indefinitely, you can
jasonmay [?\]: because I can't put something in E4
sartak [18k\]: I'm saying if I keep passing, you can eventually capture those stones
sartak [18k\]: So they're false eyes
sartak [18k\]: meaning they're no good for the two eyes = life thing
jasonmay [?\]: I don't see how I can ever capture them though
sartak [18k\]: heh
sartak [18k\]: You play F3, then E2, then E4
jasonmay [?\]: say I put mark E3
jasonmay [?\]: E2*
jasonmay [?\]: ok I see
jasonmay [?\]: E3 goes into atari
jasonmay [?\]: so I can put one in there
jasonmay [?\]: I get it now
sartak [18k\]: ok :)

sartak [18k\]: So the objective now is to make two eyes with the bottom group
jasonmay [?\]: just continue playing?
sartak [18k\]: pretty much
sartak [18k\]: Moves like E2 are advised

;W[gh]C[jasonmay [?\]: I have like zero skills
jasonmay [?\]: I can't find nay way out
sartak [18k\]: Hmm
jasonmay [?\]: I think I just failed 100% in making two eyes
sartak [18k\]: No you have plenty of area in the bottom left
sartak [18k\]: I'd say let H2 die
sartak [18k\]: and try to work out two eyes in the bottom left

sartak [18k\]: You just filled in your own eye
jasonmay [?\]: you would have taken it
jasonmay [?\]: I'm gonna make new eyes
jasonmay [?\]: if possible
sartak [18k\]: You could've just played B1
jasonmay [?\]: you still would have taken it
sartak [18k\]: OK I'll review that later
jasonmay [?\]: ko would have prevented me from remaking the eye

jasonmay [?\]: ok let's see what that one B1 play could have been
sartak [18k\]: have to end the game first
jasonmay [?\]: should I pass, resign, or can I just continue playing?
sartak [18k\]: Here resigning is probably the best move.
sartak [18k\]: If you pass you suggest that you might have a chance at winning
sartak [18k\]: If you continue playing you insult me by thinking you can recover
sartak [18k\]: (not that I'd be insulted, but that's how people see it)
sartak [18k\]: ok

sartak [18k\]: You probably dispute the bottom
sartak [18k\]: We can play that out if you'd like
jasonmay [?\]: what about the bottom?
sartak [18k\]: You should disagree that it's dead
jasonmay [?\]: ok
sartak [18k\]: which means we play it out
jasonmay [?\]: ok
