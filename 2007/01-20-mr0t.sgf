sartak [16k\]: yeah I wasn't thinking
]
;W[ff]C[mr0t [30k?\]: why'd you play F7?
sartak [16k\]: this move
mr0t [29k?\]: F4?
sartak [16k\]: yes, heh
mr0t [29k?\]: good or bad?
sartak [16k\]: I was pretty resigned to the fact that D8 is dead and C8 will connect
sartak [16k\]: so at that point all I can do is fight somewhere else
mr0t [29k?\]: yeah
sartak [16k\]: and try to at least control the bottom of the board
mr0t [29k?\]: is it just any kind of triangle, or that specific one where it abuts against your pieces?
]
(;B[gf]TR[gd][fe][gf]C[sartak [16k\]: G4 is a fine response
sartak [16k\]: a good one even
sartak [16k\]: since it makes this shape
sartak [16k\]: which is a very good shape :)
sartak [16k\]: it's called the tiger's mouth
sartak [16k\]: on the other hand
sartak [16k\]: This specific arrangement of these three stones
mr0t [29k?\]: ok
mr0t [29k?\]: what were you gonna say?
sartak [16k\]: since if white tries to play at G5 then you clamp down and capture
mr0t [29k?\]: right
]
(;W[hf]
;B[he]C[mr0t [29k?\]: ok :)
sartak [16k\]: Any reason why H5 and not G5? :)
mr0t [29k?\]: the only part where I impressed myself is when I used the 'ko' rule to my advantage, coming up in a bit here
sartak [16k\]: It did set up a ko
sartak [16k\]: yep
sartak [16k\]: hehe

;W[ge]
;B[ie]C[sartak [16k\]: it's called tenuki
]
;W[hd]C[mr0t [30k?\]: tenuki eh
sartak [16k\]: playing somewhere nonlocal
sartak [16k\]: though 9x9 is pretty local
mr0t [30k?\]: well when  you played F7 and I played F8 you basically gave me an extra space of territory rather than if you had just allowed me to capture E6 and F6 by playing at F7 myself
sartak [16k\]: hrm
sartak [16k\]: this was a bad move by me
]
(;B[id]C[sartak [16k\]: I'm not sure I follow, after the game I'll review the situation
mr0t [29k?\]: heh
sartak [16k\]: your response wasn't very good
mr0t [29k?\]: but J6 wasnt a good response
sartak [16k\]: well, it was ok

;W[hc]
;B[hg]
;W[if]
;B[gf]C[sartak [16k\]: now here I was worried
sartak [16k\]: :)
sartak [16k\]: because there are no ko threats for me
sartak [16k\]: in this case
sartak [16k\]: A ko threat would be something I play here that you _have_ to respond to
mr0t [29k?\]: hm
sartak [16k\]: so then after you respond I can take back the ko
sartak [16k\]: but even still J3 is pretty damning
sartak [16k\]: so it doesn't quite apply here
mr0t [29k?\]: really?
mr0t [29k?\]: hm
sartak [16k\]: well there's nothing I can do to stop you from playing J3
sartak [16k\]: which breaks the ko
mr0t [29k?\]: oh, ok
sartak [16k\]: I meant damning for me :)

(;B[fg]C[mr0t [29k?\]: H8 was even unecessary?
sartak [16k\]: ohyeah
mr0t [29k?\]: I could have gotten some of that bottom-right territory if I hadn't have done that, I think
sartak [16k\]: F3 would've been a stellar move
sartak [16k\]: yep
sartak [16k\]: and there's no way white can make life in the upper right
sartak [16k\]: so you can ignore that group and mark it as dead after the game
mr0t [29k?\]: I can kinda see why it's better to 'imply' an eye than actually form it completely
sartak [16k\]: which is what you should do for two reasons
sartak [16k\]: 1) moves like F3 which are way good
sartak [16k\]: 2) by explicitly capturing my group you're playing stones in your own territory
sartak [16k\]: thus lowering your score
sartak [16k\]: If you had played F3 I probably would've just flat-out resigned
mr0t [29k?\]: doesnt it cancel out with the stones I captured?
sartak [16k\]: only if I keep playing in your territory
mr0t [29k?\]: hm
sartak [16k\]: which I wasn't
