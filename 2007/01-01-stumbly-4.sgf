amni [1k\]: there's always handicap stones
sartak [11k?\]: woo
sartak [11k?\]: han: Do you know how to set up a game?
sartak [11k?\]: It's pretty easy. Just click custom game in the games room and make sure everything's peachy
sartak [11k?\]: No time limits, free game, board size 9, no handicap, and that should do it
HanClinto [?\]: Okay, cool
stumbly [21k?\]: ok, back to lobby
