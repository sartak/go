;W[ei]
;B[hh]C[sartak [16k\]: E5 was a misplay. I should've played at H6 to prevent a fatal cut. Or E6 so I could've killed that group instead of having to extend H7.
sartak [16k\]: :|

doy [?\]: (:
sartak [16k\]: no it's cool
sartak [16k\]: Even if you had spotted that move my H7 group woulda survived
sartak [16k\]: since I could've escaped and captured F7 before you could've captured my group
sartak [16k\]: there's a word for that, a race to capture. Lemme look it up :)
sartak [16k\]: semeai

;B[jh]
;W[hh]C[sartak [16k\]: Notice how I have an empty triangle
sartak [16k\]: bad sartak!
doy [?\]: i'm noticing
sartak [16k\]: :)
doy [?\]: and i'm trying to exploit it
sartak [16k\]: good!
doy [?\]: but it doesn't look like it's going to work out
doy [?\]: you're already too close to capturing the group at f7
sartak [16k\]: aye
sartak [16k\]: ("the group at" is redundant :))

doy [?\]: (:
doy [?\]: i'm sure that will come in time though
sartak [16k\]: a-yup
sartak [16k\]: I play more through instinct though, gut reactions

sartak [16k\]: hmm
sartak [16k\]: eh I'll wait

sartak [16k\]: OK well now I can ask
sartak [16k\]: I'm wondering how the empty triangle just above K5 was made
sartak [16k\]: but we can find out for real once the game is over
sartak [16k\]: (if I had mentioned K7 earlier I was worried I'd inform you of the shortness of liberties of J4)

;W[lh]C[doy [?\]: well, l7 was my third move
sartak [16k\]: I as in L?

sartak [16k\]: I'll pass now
doy [?\]: my train of thought has this tendency to forget things at the beginning
doy [?\]: i was like "i don't need to take that now because i can do it later"
