sartak [?\]: yay :)
LucasOman: haha love the icon
LucasOman: ok i'm a complete newb
sartak [?\]: you can resize the window to get a bigger board
LucasOman: don't even really know the rules
sartak [?\]: yeah I like it too :)
sartak [?\]: that's fine, I'm happy to teach them
sartak [?\]: so it's a 2 player game with each player alternating
sartak [?\]: each turn you place a stone on the board
sartak [?\]: you're up first I think
sartak [?\]: ok
LucasOman: i guess it stands to reason that it's impossible (or completely unprofitable) to replace any of the pieces that were removed
LucasOman: hehe ok
sartak [?\]: so you know you can't put a stone into instadeath
sartak [?\]: and you must rob a group of ALL of its liberties to capture it
sartak [?\]: these two rules have an interesting and beautiful interaction
sartak [?\]: ok. let's play actual Go
LucasOman: ok

;W[ed]C[sartak [?\]: I do love the game, I just could never find anyone else to play it with, so I frustratedly quit
LucasOman: well that's sad
sartak [?\]: yeah :)
LucasOman: i'm entertained so far
LucasOman: maybe i'll fill that void
sartak [?\]: you ain't seen nothin yet!
sartak [?\]: as I'm sure you know..
sartak [?\]: chess has been effectively conquered
LucasOman: i know how you feel... i have boxes and boxes of star wars role playing card game
sartak [?\]: (see Deep Blue vs Kasparov)
LucasOman: yeh it's sad
sartak [?\]: the very best Go programs can play at the level of only an amateur
LucasOman: chess is one of those games that can be brute-forced
LucasOman: that's its downfall
sartak [?\]: yep

sartak [?\]: to develop intuitions about how things work

;W[bd]
(;B[ae]C[sartak [?\]: I wouldn't have played here though

;W[cf]C[sartak [?\]: how's A7 look?
LucasOman: bad
sartak [?\]: good :)
LucasOman: then you hit A4

sartak [?\]: so here
sartak [?\]: do you envision any of your groups making two eyes?
LucasOman: nope
sartak [?\]: nod
sartak [?\]: so interestingly
sartak [?\]: the game is over when the players agree it's over
sartak [?\]: instead of placing a stone you can pass your turn
sartak [?\]: if both players pass in succession, then the game is done
LucasOman: ah gotcha
sartak [?\]: so you should probably pass
sartak [?\]: since it's not likely you'll get any further

sartak [?\]: living groups that is
sartak [?\]: there are two other states
sartak [?\]: dead
sartak [?\]: which means it's clear the group is not going to mak eit
sartak [?\]: your C7 group is a good example
sartak [?\]: so we mark that as dead with this software by clicking on it
sartak [?\]: the mini stones on each intersection
sartak [?\]: those are all points for me, because I completely surround them
sartak [?\]: you receive no points for the stones actually on the board. only the ones you've captured and the territory you surround
sartak [?\]: ok so the other group state is just "unknown"
sartak [?\]: the top right might be considered unknown
sartak [?\]: if that's the case then we can just continue playing
sartak [?\]: until the state of that group is known
LucasOman: all are surrounded
sartak [?\]: you don't need to absorb all of this right now
sartak [?\]: just braindumping at you so you get some of the details
LucasOman: hehe
sartak [?\]: ok, now let's review
sartak [?\]: the chat widget actually sits on top of another widget
sartak [?\]: you can resize the chat widget to see the other
sartak [?\]: it's a tree of all the states of the game
LucasOman: oh cool
sartak [?\]: ah, we have to finish off the game first
sartak [?\]: click done
sartak [?\]: ok so the widget lets you see any game state

LucasOman: it's 3am

LucasOman: or you lose your F4 now, which was your branch out
sartak [?\]: you wouldn't really attack H7 directly
sartak [?\]: since I would crush you
sartak [?\]: and if you attacked the little H6 group
sartak [?\]: I could always connect if I needed to
sartak [?\]: so while H7 does help
sartak [?\]: there are more helpful moves

LucasOman: it let me play there when it wouldn't before
sartak [?\]: and get the stone right back
sartak [?\]: ok
sartak [?\]: first let's address that
LucasOman: then we'd get into a back-and-forth
sartak [?\]: you cannot put stones on the board if they would die instantly
sartak [?\]: however, if in the act of being put down they free up liberties (aka they capture) then it's OK
sartak [?\]: now we could endlessly back-and-forth over E8 and E7, yes
sartak [?\]: the Ko rule forbids me from repeating the same state of the board, so I can't play E7 this turn
sartak [?\]: so I make a threat somewhere else

sartak [?\]: or respond to the threat
