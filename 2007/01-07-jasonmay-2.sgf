jasonmay [?\]: *fistshake*
sartak [18k\]: hee
jasonmay [?\]: I can't even fathom how you manage to come up with shit like that
sartak [18k\]: luck mostly
jasonmay [?\]: heh
sartak [18k\]: if you keep playing you'll grok these patterns as well
jasonmay [?\]: yeha
jasonmay [?\]: I bet yesterday or two days ago I wouldn't have known I was even trapped and woudl have just made it worse for myself

;W[hb]C[sartak [18k\]: By the way
jasonmay [?\]: hm?
sartak [18k\]: D5 wasn't a very good play. It was inefficient and redundant
sartak [18k\]: Since D6 and D4 are virtually connected
jasonmay [?\]: yeah
sartak [18k\]: no way I can cut them if you're determined
jasonmay [?\]: is J11-J13 dead?
sartak [18k\]: yup
]
;B[le]
;W[ld]C[sartak [18k\]: Not a terrible play, but better than trying to salvage J11-J13
sartak [18k\]: You had sente, which basically means initiative.
sartak [18k\]: which is very good to have
sartak [18k\]: Since you get to determine what to attack, I can only respond
sartak [18k\]: s/,/./
sartak [18k\]: Well, M9 is fine, but it'll eventually die
sartak [18k\]: better would've been something like K6
]
;B[jh]C[jasonmay [?\]: hah
sartak [18k\]: force me to use up turns capturing H8 while you're building up a defense
jasonmay [?\]: I didn't even read that
]
;W[jf]C[sartak [18k\]: actually
sartak [18k\]: I should've played K5
]
;B[kf]
;W[ji]C[jasonmay [?\]: oops
sartak [18k\]: So K6 wasn't a very good move, but we both made that mistake, so it's cool
]
;B[kh]
;W[ki]
;B[ii]C[sartak [18k\]: better :)
]
;W[hg]C[sartak [18k\]: ok so maybe K6 was a good play after all
]
;B[fg]
;W[kg]C[sartak [18k\]: should've attacked L5

sartak [18k\]: wasn't a very good play :/
jasonmay [?\]: securing an eye?
sartak [18k\]: and even then H4 would've been better :)
jasonmay [?\]: I guess I'm still not good at determining true eyes
jasonmay [?\]: maybe
sartak [18k\]: but it's a bad play because it doesn't _really_ help

jasonmay [?\]: yeah
