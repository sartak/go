(;B[dd]C[sartak [?\]: this move was worthless
sartak [?\]: since you're just filling in what are called "dabe"
sartak [?\]: er, "dame"
sartak [?\]: which is territory owned by neither side
sartak [?\]: you do not get points for the stones on the board, only the empty spaces which they surround

sartak [?\]: you don't have to
sartak [?\]: nope
sartak [?\]: but I've won by a lot
Sicer: lol
sartak [?\]: maybe 30 points
Sicer: ah.
sartak [?\]: pass or play
Sicer: so.. is this like game over then?
Sicer: siince u passed
sartak [?\]: we both have to pass in a row for the game to end
sartak [?\]: if you think you can increase your score, continue playing
sartak [?\]: I don't think you can, or I can

;B[hc]C[sartak [?\]: you didn't need to play there
sartak [?\]: and this move is playing in your own territory. no way I can invade, and you already have eyes
sartak [?\]: so this move would have cost you a point
sartak [?\]: well, thanks for playing :)
sartak [?\]: any questions before we part ways?
Sicer: you gonna play any d2?
sartak [?\]: I actually played most of the time you were gone :/
Sicer: HC?
sartak [?\]: nope
Sicer: k, good.
sartak [?\]: rushed a sorc to act 5, level 18 now
sartak [?\]: gonna to meteorb
sartak [?\]: since I need a dual-element sorc
sartak [?\]: lightning is good but as soon as I hit a lightning immune it's "run awaayyy!"
Sicer: did you put d2 on the comp downstairs, or is it still ur laptop?
sartak [?\]: laptop
sartak [?\]: you have the CD you burned in your drive
sartak [?\]: because whenever it got to a movie it complained
sartak [?\]: but with the CD it was fine
Sicer: the cd we burned was thrown away
sartak [?\]: I pulled an audrey
sartak [?\]: :)
sartak [?\]: it was clean, it was sitting on top of a paper plate
