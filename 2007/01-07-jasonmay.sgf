jasonmay [?\]: yuck
sartak [18k\]: Well
sartak [18k\]: For what it's worth
sartak [18k\]: You did good in not trying to save D11
sartak [18k\]: (or did you just fail to see it was in atari? :))
jasonmay [?\]: latter
sartak [18k\]: ah
sartak [18k\]: sacrifice is still something I'm a bit too uncomfortable with
jasonmay [?\]: I was trying to set up a ladder trap
sartak [18k\]: yeah
jasonmay [?\]: but I misplaced the F13 I think
sartak [18k\]: yep it'd really be H12 I think
jasonmay [?\]: yeah
sartak [18k\]: in any case you didn't even need a ladder trap because your group wouldn't be in atari for the ladder since it has a liberty at E8
jasonmay [?\]: I figured you would have placed one there while I was setting up the trap
jasonmay [?\]: or something
sartak [18k\]: :)
jasonmay [?\]: and if you didn't, I would have
sartak [18k\]: White here could've won
sartak [18k\]: well, I mean, won this fight
jasonmay [?\]: yeah
sartak [18k\]: You can escape if I ever try to play E8
jasonmay [?\]: yeah
sartak [18k\]: and if I play E8 after the ladder is done you just double atari me
jasonmay [?\]: yeah
jasonmay [?\]: that would have been awesome
jasonmay [?\]: but I'm still a little too stupid
jasonmay [?\]: but I think I'm getting better
sartak [18k\]: naw just inexperienced
sartak [18k\]: you are
sartak [18k\]: You're cutting and connecting more
