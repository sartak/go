;B[gf]C[sartak [16k\]: hello sir
sartak [16k\]: Do you know about the rule of ko?
sartak [16k\]: It's the only mildly difficult rule
]
;W[cc]C[mr0t: as I understand it, you can't make the same move twice in a row
sartak [16k\]: sort of
mr0t: in the instance where your opponent reverses the move you made
sartak [16k\]: yes
sartak [16k\]: That's it
sartak [16k\]: You can't repeat board state

;W[eh]C[mr0t: its fascinating to me how computers can beat any human at chess, but not so with go
sartak [16k\]: :)
sartak [16k\]: yeah
]
;B[ch]C[sartak [16k\]: Some bots can still beat me
sartak [16k\]: but aioli's at the point where he can beat any bot
mr0t: how long have you been playing?
sartak [16k\]: a month
]
;W[cf]C[mr0t: 16kyu is pretty good right? it goes down starting from 30 kyu?
sartak [16k\]: technically
sartak [16k\]: Advancement is very rapid in the beginning
sartak [16k\]: 9k is probably the first rank that can be said to be any good

;B[de]
;W[ed]C[mr0t: well let me put it this way.. i've never won against a bot :)

;B[ii]
;W[ia]C[sartak [16k\]: you don't need to capture J2
sartak [16k\]: we can mark it as dead in the endgame
sartak [16k\]: well, postgame
mr0t: the game's pretty much over right?
sartak [16k\]: yeah I'd say it's over
]
;B[]C[sartak [16k\]: The only possible move for you is G3
sartak [16k\]: which forces me to connect at E1
sartak [16k\]: which actually gives you a point
mr0t: hm
sartak [16k\]: but too late :)

;W[]TW[ca][ea][db][af][bf][ag][cg][dg][ah][ch][ai][bi][di]TB[hd][id][ee][ge][he][ie][if][ih]C[sartak [16k\]: hmm
mr0t: which stones are dead?
sartak [16k\]: So E1 isn't considered mine
sartak [16k\]: so you playing G3 wouldn't have done anything
sartak [16k\]: Only B4
sartak [16k\]: which I've marked as dead
mr0t: ah, ok.
mr0t: that was fun :)
sartak [16k\]: yes :)
sartak [16k\]: Click done sir
mr0t: you werent going easy on me were you
sartak [16k\]: not at all
