PW[sartak]PB[Kitsy]DT[2007-10-09]PC[The KGS Go Server at http://www.gokgs.com/]C[sartak [?\]: hello hello
Kitsy [?\]: ^_^
sartak [?\]: so I'll just start from the first rule, let me know if I'm going too slow or fast
Kitsy [?\]: Ok =D
Kitsy [?\]: All I've seen is one board, one day, and that's pretty much it haha
sartak [?\]: so Go is a game played between two players. they take turns putting stones onto the intersections of the board
sartak [?\]: hm
sartak [?\]: so. stones may be captured
sartak [?\]: you can do this by surrounding them
sartak [?\]: stones can also form an indivisible unit
Kitsy [?\]: Uhh ok =P
Kitsy [?\]: Aah
sartak [?\]: just to make sure you're solid on stones making groups, and how capture works
sartak [?\]: so one rule is
Kitsy [?\]: Ok
sartak [?\]: you cannot put a stone down if it would be immediately captured
sartak [?\]: so there are some interesting patterns that arise because of the rules you know so far
Kitsy [?\]: Oh I capture your stuff before? o_o
sartak [?\]: hmm?
sartak [?\]: so to solidify the rule of capture:
sartak [?\]: a group is captured if it has zero liberties
sartak [?\]: a group with one liberty is said to be in atari
sartak [?\]: let's play again :)
Kitsy [?\]: That means danger I guess?
sartak [?\]: this time we won't stop after a capture
sartak [?\]: yep
Kitsy [?\]: Or something like that
sartak [?\]: not sure of what the actual word means though
sartak [?\]: (I guess that's what you were actually asking)
sartak [?\]: ok. you're up :)
Kitsy [?\]: Has to mean ''watch out I'm going to get ya''
sartak [?\]: so let me show you some interesting shapes
Kitsy [?\]: Ook ^^
sartak [?\]: you've seen the ladder
sartak [?\]: :)
sartak [?\]: sorry, trying to phrase it as a problem
Kitsy [?\]: Haa ok =P
Kitsy [?\]: Ok I guess there's one called the dog that fetches the dinosaur bone or something? =D
sartak [?\]: haha
sartak [?\]: not that I know of :)
Kitsy [?\]: Ain't H4 to H1 vulnerable?
sartak [?\]: yes
sartak [?\]: those were just there to demonstrate the seki
Kitsy [?\]: Aah ok
sartak [?\]: hmmmm
Kitsy [?\]: So best move would be E6
sartak [?\]: yeah :)
Kitsy [?\]: For white
Kitsy [?\]: And E6 for black, for that matter
sartak [?\]: or something else entirely
stumbly [?\]: yes, but where does B play next
Kitsy [?\]: How about we play one more? xD
sartak [?\]: first of all, play more. :) it's never a bad thing to learn by playing
sartak [?\]: ok! sure
sartak [?\]: maybe I ought to get a handicap :D
sartak [?\]: I played better
sartak [?\]: :)
Kitsy [?\]: =P
Kitsy [?\]: I like that game! =O
sartak [?\]: yes! it's the best game ever :)
sartak [?\]: wait til you try 19x19
Kitsy [?\]: Gaah I'll die on those x_x
sartak [?\]: alas it's 2am here and I have work tomorrow, so I can't play much more tonight
Kitsy [?\]: 2 am here too =X
sartak [?\]: hehe
Kitsy [?\]: Quebec powa xD
sartak [?\]: Massachusetts \\o/
sartak [?\]: (though America is going down the shitter..)
Kitsy [?\]: Bit farther =P
sartak [?\]: anyway, back to what matters most :)
sartak [?\]: there are some very good Go websites
sartak [?\]: 1) senseis.xmp.net - Sensei's Library
sartak [?\]: a very good Go wiki
sartak [?\]: 2) goproblems.com
sartak [?\]: self-explanatory. do time trials. very very helpful
Kitsy [?\]: ^_^
sartak [?\]: 3) playgo.to/interactive - a site to teach you the basics of Go. you've graduated beyond this, but you might want to go through it anyway
sartak [?\]: I might have missed little things
Kitsy [?\]: =P
sartak [?\]: so Go also has a natural rating syste
sartak [?\]: system
sartak [?\]: players start at 30 ky
sartak [?\]: kyu
Kitsy [?\]: Ok
sartak [?\]: a player who you can beat half the time with a 2 stone handicap is a 28 kyu
sartak [?\]: basically, the ratings are defined in terms of handicap
Kitsy [?\]: ^_^
sartak [?\]: (in fact, the difference in rating is often expressed as a number of stones)
sartak [?\]: "he's 4 stones stronger"
Kitsy [?\]: So, let's say I'm 25kyu and someone beats me half the time at 8 handicap, he's 17?
sartak [?\]: yep
sartak [?\]: this is on 19x19
Kitsy [?\]: Ho ok
sartak [?\]: (on 9x9, handicap is more powerful)
sartak [?\]: I've been told I'm about 15 kyu
sartak [?\]: that doesn't necessarily mean I can beat a 1 kyu half the time with 14 stones :)
Kitsy [?\]: =
Kitsy [?\]: =P
sartak [?\]: (handicap works less well the bigger the difference)
sartak [?\]: so after 1 kyu is 1 dan
sartak [?\]: and then it goes back up
Kitsy [?\]: ^^
sartak [?\]: to confuse matters further
Kitsy [?\]: 30 to 1, and 1 to 30?
sartak [?\]: well, no, dan doesn't go that high really
sartak [?\]: it's closer to 6 or 7 max
Kitsy [?\]: Ah-ha =P
sartak [?\]: (though brilliant players can go beyond that)
Kitsy [?\]: o_o
sartak [?\]: the best player who has ever lived, who lived in the 1700s
sartak [?\]: has been called a 13 dan
Kitsy [?\]: Waaa o_o
sartak [?\]: which means that the next best players would need a few stones to beat him
sartak [?\]: so to confuse matters further, there's ANOTHER set of dan levels
sartak [?\]: reserved for professionals
Kitsy [?\]: That's silly xD
sartak [?\]: yes
sartak [?\]: nowadays the professional dans are called pings
sartak [?\]: to differentiate
Kitsy [?\]: Why not go from 1 to 50 upwards haha
sartak [?\]: :)
sartak [?\]: dunno
Kitsy [?\]: Cuz japanese folks like complicated stuff? =D
Kitsy [?\]: Or chinese?
sartak [?\]: hehe
Kitsy [?\]: Or whoever invented it
sartak [?\]: Go is originally from China
sartak [?\]: but I dunno where ratings came from
sartak [?\]: well, that's about it I guess :)
Kitsy [?\]: ^_^!
Kitsy [?\]: Well that's a nice game hehe
sartak [?\]: I'd like to play a 19x19 with you, soon
sartak [?\]: preferably before you get much stronger than you already are
sartak [?\]: :)
Kitsy [?\]: Weeeell I'm on a one-week school break =P
Kitsy [?\]: So I'll most likely be here tomorrow hehe
sartak [?\]: cool
Kitsy [?\]: Well, later today actually haha
sartak [?\]: KGS has a buddy list system, in the menu under User
sartak [?\]: I'm going to head to bed
sartak [?\]: good night. :) hope you enjoy the game
Kitsy [?\]: Ya ^^
Kitsy [?\]: Added you in friends =P
sartak [?\]: :)
sartak [?\]: bye
Kitsy [?\]: G'night to you too =D

sartak [?\]: so Go has an elegant and natural handicap system (unlike, say, chess)
Kitsy [?\]: There's an handicap system at chess? xD
sartak [?\]: basically the weaker player gets free turns

sartak [?\]: I'll talk about it after the game
Kitsy [?\]: Infinite loop =D
sartak [?\]: cripes :)
sartak [?\]: I don't believe this is your first game sir!
Kitsy [?\]: Wow they really thought up everything o_O
Kitsy [?\]: Heeeey meanie >_<
sartak [?\]: it's a compliment
Kitsy [?\]: It's just obvious that it's an infinite loop >_<
Kitsy [?\]: =P
Kitsy [?\]: C4 C3 C4 C3 capture capture capture capture x_x
sartak [?\]: yup
Kitsy [?\]: But can I play on it sometime?
sartak [?\]: so the rule that forbids this infinite loop is called the rule of ko
sartak [?\]: yes
sartak [?\]: the rule of ko forbids the repetition of the same board state
sartak [?\]: so if you play somewhere else, then I play somewhere else, you can recapture
Kitsy [?\]: Ah nice
sartak [?\]: (and then ko forbids me from immediately recapturing)
Kitsy [?\]: hehe
sartak [?\]: ko adds a very interesting dimension to the game: the ko fight
sartak [?\]: so here you want to play what is called a ko threat
sartak [?\]: a move that I must respond to
sartak [?\]: and then you recapture the ko
Kitsy [?\]: Well I don't want you to take B3, so I'll play A1 haha
sartak [?\]: then I play a ko threat, etc
]
;B[ai]C[sartak [?\]: eventually the ko threats become less valuable than the ko itself, so someone will fill it in

;W[ae]C[Kitsy [?\]: Waaaait a minute...

;W[bh]C[Kitsy [?\]: It has 2 now >_<

sartak [?\]: A4 looks like an eye

sartak [?\]: so here's how it should have played out, if I wasn't terrible :D
Kitsy [?\]: Waa that's like a total lockdown x_x
sartak [?\]: yeah
sartak [?\]: this way it's clear who owns what territory
sartak [?\]: so if neither player resigns
sartak [?\]: the game ends when both players pass
Kitsy [?\]: But I still got the right =D
sartak [?\]: and then KGS changes to this display
Kitsy [?\]: The tiny-dot display?
sartak [?\]: yep, this is scoring mode
sartak [?\]: the tiny dots indicate territory
sartak [?\]: each tiny dot is worth a point
Kitsy [?\]: Then why don't they give me the right part? o_o
sartak [?\]: because KGS doesn't know that this triangle group is dead
sartak [?\]: so we tell it it's dead by clicking on it
Kitsy [?\]: Ooh
sartak [?\]: now it looks better :)
sartak [?\]: so you have a lot of territory
Kitsy [?\]: And what about a9?
sartak [?\]: :) so quick
sartak [?\]: so
sartak [?\]: A9 is owned by neither player
sartak [?\]: it's called "dame"
sartak [?\]: filling it in would just be a waste of a turn, more or less
sartak [?\]: let's say black plays H2
Kitsy [?\]: Ah I guess
sartak [?\]: that would cost him a point
sartak [?\]: because you don't get points for the stones you have on the board
Kitsy [?\]: Aah yeah, uh, about those, won't it change anything? o_o
Kitsy [?\]: Uh be back in 30 seconds x_
sartak [?\]: I don't understand what you're asking
sartak [?\]: ok
Kitsy [?\]: x_x
Kitsy [?\]: Back
sartak [?\]: ok
sartak [?\]: so you don't get points just for the stones you have on the board
Kitsy [?\]: Ok uh, the captures and all, and the 7 I got?
sartak [?\]: ok, captures are each a point, yes
sartak [?\]: the last component of score is komi
Kitsy [?\]: Ooh so it adds up to my territory?
sartak [?\]: your score is territory + captures + komi
sartak [?\]: komi is a bonus for being white (that is, going second)
sartak [?\]: because otherwise black would have an advantage
sartak [?\]: komi is usually 6.5 points
Kitsy [?\]: Wasn't that the 6.5 thingie number at the beginning when you created the game? o_O
sartak [?\]: the .5 means no games end in a draw :)
sartak [?\]: yes it wa

Kitsy [?\]: Uh-huh, cuz it's all surrounded then
sartak [?\]: d
sartak [?\]: yep
Kitsy [?\]: Oh, so it's sort of an initiative thing
sartak [?\]: I suppose
sartak [?\]: so the empty intersections next to a group have a name
sartak [?\]: each is a liberty
Kitsy [?\]: Ok, I just thought it was suicide for white =P
sartak [?\]: ahhh I'm sorry
sartak [?\]: I misunderstood
sartak [?\]: yes. white can play at J1
sartak [?\]: it does look like suicide
sartak [?\]: but it's OK because he's capturing while being played

Kitsy [?\]: s'ok =P
sartak [?\]: so
Kitsy [?\]: Ok, so empty intersections next to a group are liberties
sartak [?\]: how many white groups are on the board?
sartak [?\]: yep
Kitsy [?\]: Um... 4?
sartak [?\]: right
sartak [?\]: how many liberties does each have?
sartak [?\]: (it's a bit of counting, yes :))
Kitsy [?\]: The 5-group has 10, 4 has 9, 2 has 5 and 1 has 2
