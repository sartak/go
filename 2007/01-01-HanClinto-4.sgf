HanClinto [?\]: You captured more stones, but I had more points
sartak [11k?\]: Nice work sir
HanClinto [?\]: You as well!
HanClinto [?\]: I thought you were winning
HanClinto [?\]: But I guess not
sartak [11k?\]: The 6.5 komi points helped :)
HanClinto [?\]: Komi?
sartak [11k?\]: It's the bonus you get for going second
HanClinto [?\]: Ah
HanClinto [?\]: Okay
HanClinto [?\]: So you did win
sartak [11k?\]: nope!
HanClinto [?\]: Without it, I wouldn't have won
HanClinto [?\]: (from board position I mean)
sartak [11k?\]: You're definitely the winner bud :)
sartak [11k?\]: One more?
sartak [11k?\]: Last one though, I don't want to keep you from your wife. :)
HanClinto [?\]: I'm sitting next to her
HanClinto [?\]: But we're actually going to play scrabble now
