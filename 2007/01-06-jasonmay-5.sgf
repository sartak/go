;W[db]C[jasonmay [?\]: I think my flaw is that I let you make a million eyes
sartak [18k\]: :)
jasonmay [?\]: which I'm not sure how to prevent
sartak [18k\]: Just be more aggressive. Cutting should work well for you
sartak [18k\]: since you have so much more material on the board
jasonmay [?\]: doesn't cutting require making a double atari?
sartak [18k\]: nah
sartak [18k\]: It just means preventing a group from connecting
sartak [18k\]: well, two groups
jasonmay [?\]: let me look through the interactive thing real quick
sartak [18k\]: sure
]
;B[ed]C[sartak [18k\]: good
sartak [18k\]: That not only cuts E7 and F6, but it also forces me to capture E8
]
;W[ea]C[sartak [18k\]: now all you have to do is keep the pressure up and you'll probably win
jasonmay [?\]: but now no matter where I go, you'll make eyes
jasonmay [?\]: (near the top anyway)
sartak [18k\]: well
sartak [18k\]: If you play D7, then I have to fill my eye
sartak [18k\]: because I really don't want you to capture E7
sartak [18k\]: (that'd connect F7 and E6 and leave me in a bad way)(
jasonmay [?\]: ok
jasonmay [?\]: I keep forgetting I'll have two consecutive stones
]
;B[dc]
;W[eb]C[sartak [18k\]: It'll be difficult for me to make two good eyes up there if you attack
jasonmay [?\]: wait, if you didn't do that, I still couldn't capture E7
jasonmay [?\]: because it's an auto-die thing
sartak [18k\]: no
sartak [18k\]: The rule forbids suicide
sartak [18k\]: It's not suicide if you capture stones with the one you're placing.
sartak [18k\]: since you're freeing up liberties
jasonmay [?\]: it still keeps looking like you can make eyes no matter what :(
sartak [18k\]: I can probably make two false eyes
sartak [18k\]: But if you play well I can't make two real eyes and live
sartak [18k\]: There are four good moves right now
sartak [18k\]: for you
jasonmay [?\]: I'll mark the point there you can make an eye
jasonmay [?\]: maybe that will do something
]
;B[ca]C[sartak [18k\]: That's one of the four good plays :)
jasonmay [?\]: ok
]
;W[gb]
;B[ga]C[sartak [18k\]: excellent
sartak [18k\]: Now!
]
;W[ha]C[sartak [18k\]: be careful here :)
jasonmay [?\]: I can see a possible win, but as usual, I'm overlooking something
sartak [18k\]: Just play it out, if you screw up no big deal
]
;B[hb]C[sartak [18k\]: yes!
sartak [18k\]: hmm
jasonmay [?\]: yep, the top right, overlooked that
]
;W[hc]C[jasonmay [?\]: it just makes it a little harder for me than I though
sartak [18k\]: You played the right moves
sartak [18k\]: Denying me my eyes
sartak [18k\]: however I think I can survive, killing F7
jasonmay [?\]: yeah
sartak [18k\]: so here
sartak [18k\]: in your shoes I'd play something like H5
jasonmay [?\]: what about C8?
jasonmay [?\]: would that do anything?
sartak [18k\]: It's kind of a wasted stone: if I play C8 you just play B8
sartak [18k\]: but that's the right idea: you want to stop my spread
]
;B[he]
;W[ff]
;B[fe]
;W[gd]C[jasonmay [?\]: F7/G7 are inevitable eyes, right?
sartak [18k\]: Well that's only one eyes
sartak [18k\]: er eye
sartak [18k\]: but yes, pretty much
sartak [18k\]: Also I have some eyespace at the very corner

;W[ic]
;B[id]
;W[ib]
;B[hd]
;W[ha]C[jasonmay [?\]: missed that
sartak [18k\]: now let's see if you can pick out the best move
sartak [18k\]: I'd say there definitely is one
]
(;B[gf]C[sartak [18k\]: ok
jasonmay [?\]: I'm curious to see this
sartak [18k\]: See how much better that looks? ;)
sartak [18k\]: Now I want to save F4
sartak [18k\]: but I don't think I can
sartak [18k\]: but I'll play it out anyway
]
;W[fg]C[sartak [18k\]: oh, I haven't shown you the net
]
;B[eg]C[jasonmay [?\]: dno't worry abou tit
]
;W[fh]C[sartak [18k\]: ok
sartak [18k\]: I'll show you how to kill F4 after the game
]
;B[fi]
;W[gi]
;B[gh]
;W[ei]C[sartak [18k\]: good move btw, if you had tried to escape it would've strengthened me immensely
]
;B[di]
;W[hh]
;B[eh]
;W[fi]
;B[ii]
;W[ih]
;B[hg]C[sartak [18k\]: poor move on my part
]
;W[ig]
;B[if]
;W[hf]C[sartak [18k\]: :)
sartak [18k\]: ok
sartak [18k\]: The game's just about over
sartak [18k\]: The only thing left is one of us has to play C8
sartak [18k\]: since it's your turn you get to
]
;B[cb]
;W[]C[jasonmay [?\]: should I pass too?
sartak [18k\]: yeah
sartak [18k\]: You could play

sartak [18k\]: but that wouldn't help
sartak [18k\]: since you only get points for things you surround
sartak [18k\]: Much closer this time!
jasonmay [?\]: yeah
sartak [18k\]: OK, now to review the two things
])
(;B[hf]C[sartak [18k\]: nope
sartak [18k\]: G4
jasonmay [?\]: that seemed tricky
sartak [18k\]: G4 does a few things
sartak [18k\]: It cuts, preventing further development of my life
sartak [18k\]: and!
sartak [18k\]: helps H5 to survive
sartak [18k\]: and!
jasonmay [?\]: it would have caused you to make yet another eye
sartak [18k\]: and it pretty much kills F4
sartak [18k\]: well
jasonmay [?\]: oh nevermind
sartak [18k\]: Undo and play G4
jasonmay [?\]: two consecutive blacks
jasonmay [?\]: yet again, I overlooked that
sartak [18k\]: :)
sartak [18k\]: Do you want to keep playing with H3 or?
sartak [18k\]: er, H4
