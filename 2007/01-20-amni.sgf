amni [1k\]: and gl
sartak [16k\]: at least with 9H
amni [1k\]: i wish i could remember a joseki with one of those
amni [1k\]: but i can't 
sartak [16k\]: :)

sartak [16k\]: er
sartak [16k\]: first thing's first
sartak [16k\]: amni: thanks!! :)
amni [1k\]: np
sartak [16k\]: I'll keep chugging away at goproblems
amni [1k\]: that's one way
sartak [16k\]: I still haven't really played strangers
sartak [16k\]: I think that every time I have, I've lost
sartak [16k\]: :)
amni [1k\]: they play unfair
amni [1k\]: dirty unfair strangers
sartak [16k\]: yeah those damn 7ds
sartak [16k\]: whatever _that_ means
amni [1k\]: overplays of all kinds
stumbly [17k\]: means wish they were 8
amni [1k\]: you have to learn how to deal with overplays
sartak [16k\]: :)
amni [1k\]: i try not to do that
amni [1k\]: it's bs in a teaching game
sartak [16k\]: shrug
sartak [16k\]: I'll have to watch one of your rated games.
amni [1k\]: heh
amni [1k\]: well they're all archived
sartak [16k\]: yeah, but I mean in realtime!
amni [1k\]: but i don't like to play those
amni [1k\]: so much pressure
sartak [16k\]: nod
amni [1k\]: makes me jittery.
sartak [16k\]: but it'd be nice to break to the dan threshold no?
sartak [16k\]: er, break the kyu threshold, whatever
amni [1k\]: 1k is the best of the kyus
amni [1k\]: 1d is the worst of the dans
sartak [16k\]: :)
sartak [16k\]: sure when you put it that way..
amni [1k\]: :)
amni [1k\]: anyway i am fundamentally unprepared for 1d
amni [1k\]: i mean at some very basic level there are too many things i don't get
sartak [16k\]: riiight :)
sartak [16k\]: ok well I guess I'll make the game and try to lure stumbly in
amni [1k\]: is stumbly afk?

amni [1k\]: unformed 
amni [1k\]: except
sartak [16k\]: hah
amni [1k\]: white occupies the shape point at f4
amni [1k\]: so that signals bad shape for black.
sartak [16k\]: ohh yeah this shape
sartak [16k\]: the netty shape
amni [1k\]: right, exactly
sartak [16k\]: so white presciently played the eye-stealing move
amni [1k\]: right, it's the shape point because it takes away a future eye
amni [1k\]: but also because it threatens cuts

sartak [16k\]: yeah

;W[eo]TR[eo]SQ[ep][fp][fq]C[amni [1k\]: so this move is awkward to play
sartak [16k\]: how so?
sartak [16k\]: Unusual shape?
amni [1k\]: this shape is bad
sartak [16k\]: ah
amni [1k\]: it's the result of d6 being played on the 4th line instead of third
amni [1k\]: i had to play an awkward cut
amni [1k\]: but also, intrinsically, you could say that it's bad because there is an implicit empty triangle
amni [1k\]: that would be true no matter where it occurs
sartak [16k\]: :)
amni [1k\]: there's no way to punish it here, because black is too thin
]
;B[fn]
;W[dm]
;B[do]C[amni [1k\]: see, 
amni [1k\]: it's a bad shape partly because of the shortage of liberties

amni [1k\]: you should be proud for having seen that
