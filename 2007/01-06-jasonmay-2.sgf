;B[gg]
;W[gh]C[sartak [18k\]: but I'm not _that_ good
sartak [18k\]: With a handicap you can probably beat me
]
;B[fh]C[jasonmay: better than arcanehl from what I can tell
sartak [18k\]: :)
sartak [18k\]: I play more than he does

;W[gi]
;B[fi]

;B[hh]C[jasonmay: ah fuck

;W[hi]
;B[ii]C[jasonmay: this is like tic tac toe from hell, heh

;W[if]C[sartak [18k\]: I should mention that score is a function not only of territory but captures
sartak [18k\]: So moves like J4 aren't very good :)
]
;B[ie]C[jasonmay: what happened at J4?
]
;W[ff]C[sartak [18k\]: I'll show you after the game

;B[fe]

;W[dh]
;B[ch]C[stumbly [20k\]: fine example of ladder
]
;W[hf]
;B[di]
;W[ff]
;B[fg]C[sartak [18k\]: Oh
]
;W[hd]C[sartak [18k\]: The game ends when both players pass (since they don't think they can increase their score any further)
sartak [18k\]: or when one resigns
sartak [18k\]: or time runs out (we're playing without time)
]
;B[gd]C[jasonmay: pass?
sartak [18k\]: yeah you can pass instead of playing a stone
sartak [18k\]: It's one of the bottoms at the top
jasonmay: cool
]
;W[id]
;B[hc]C[jasonmay: damn it I thought I was in the green there
]
;W[ic]C[sartak [18k\]: :0
sartak [18k\]: er
sartak [18k\]: :)
sartak [18k\]: J7 is another move you shouldn't make
jasonmay: yeah I just realized that
]
;B[ib]C[stumbly [20k\]: now would be a fine time to resign
]
;W[fd]C[sartak [18k\]: See the dots at C7, E7, C3, etc?
sartak [18k\]: Those are good places to play
sartak [18k\]: well, especially in the beginning
jasonmay: ah
sartak [18k\]: It's the best spot to take when you want to control a corner or side
]
;B[ed]C[stumbly [20k\]: well, those are the handicap spoty
stumbly [20k\]: not nec best
]
;W[fc]
;B[ec]
;W[cg]
;B[cf]
;W[bg]C[sartak [18k\]: Yeah the nice thing about Go is often you can just totally drop a conflict and go somewhere else for a while
sartak [18k\]: It happens a lot more in 19x19 than 9x9

;B[bi]C[sartak [18k\]: I think the most important Go proverb for me is
sartak [18k\]: Lose your first 50 games as quickly as possible
sartak [18k\]: Just to get a feel for the game

;W[ae]C[jasonmay: oh no
sartak [18k\]: :)
sartak [18k\]: You're on the right track though
]
;B[ad]
;W[cc]
;B[cd]C[sartak [18k\]: What I just did there is called a cut
sartak [18k\]: Denying you the opportunity to connect your stones
sartak [18k\]: Cuts are crucial
sartak [18k\]: but be careful, notice how C6 only has two liberties
jasonmay: yeah
sartak [18k\]: I often try to cut only to have it smashed back in my face :)
jasonmay: my brain's too slow to follow but I'll try something
sartak [18k\]: sure
]
;W[dd]C[sartak [18k\]: Good!
sartak [18k\]: That was probably the best play for you
]
;B[de]C[sartak [18k\]: It didn't pan out because I've been dominating
jasonmay: yeah
]
;W[ac]
;B[bc]
;W[cb]C[sartak [18k\]: We can play 9x9 with 9 stones handicap (after you play Nukie) if you want, you might even win :)
]
;B[dc]C[sartak [18k\]: I'm not very good
]
;W[da]C[jasonmay: oops
]
;B[ea]C[sartak [18k\]: That move was fine
sartak [18k\]: It forced me to capture your dead stones
stumbly [20k\]: been over for a while
jasonmay: ah'
]
;W[fd]
;B[bb]
;W[ab]C[sartak [18k\]: Another thing I've been trying to learn is make every stone count
]
;B[aa]C[sartak [18k\]: so ignore things that don't really matter, and so on
sartak [18k\]: But don't worry about that yet, heh
sartak [18k\]: If you want
sartak [18k\]: We can both pass to show you how scoring works

sartak [18k\]: The little black stones are points for me
sartak [18k\]: Now
sartak [18k\]: Hey Nukie
sartak [18k\]: We didn't play out every single turn
sartak [18k\]: Because all your groups are undoubtedly dead
NukieYoe: Yo
sartak [18k\]: So I mark them as such
sartak [18k\]: If you had a dispute we could go back to the game and play it out
sartak [18k\]: so yeah
sartak [18k\]: That's about it
jasonmay: cool
sartak [18k\]: We both click done to finalize the game
sartak [18k\]: Creating a game is easy enough
amni [1k\]: so if i teach 3 people, and everyone i teach teaches 3 people...
sartak [18k\]: Does Nukie know how to play?
sartak [18k\]: amni: :)
NukieYoe: No
sartak [18k\]: ok
sartak [18k\]: Jason: You should teach him to solidify the rules for you, too
sartak [18k\]: We can chime in if you need the help
stumbly [20k\]: i'm interested to see aioli play with comments :)
jasonmay: ok
sartak [18k\]: Alright, to start a new game
sartak [18k\]: In the other window (the one with all the game listings)
sartak [18k\]: Click "Custom Game" at the top right
stumbly [20k\]: or he could laugh and me and eid for spectators
amni [1k\]: :p
sartak [18k\]: I can direct you on IRC if you need any other help
stumbly [20k\]: (well, more at me )
sartak [18k\]: Definitely do a 9x9
amni [1k\]: when you and sartak play, i notice that he overplays more and you underplay more
sartak [18k\]: :)
jasonmay: Free?
stumbly [20k\]: could be
jasonmay: Demo? Teaching?
sartak [18k\]: Free or Teaching
sartak [18k\]: Teaching is probably best
jasonmay: are you on Teaching?
jasonmay: ok
stumbly [20k\]: i'm short on some basic tactics/mechanics for sure
sartak [18k\]: You might have to leave this game to create the other one
sartak [18k\]: I dunno though
amni [1k\]: not once it's over like this.
sartak [18k\]: ah
sartak [18k\]: Ah I see it now
jasonmay: Nukie: look for boop
NukieYoe: Ok
sartak [18k\]: If anyone else tries to join, jason, just click the X next to his name
sartak [18k\]: heh
sartak [18k\]: ok see you on the other side!
