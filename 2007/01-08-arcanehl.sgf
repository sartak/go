;B[cj]C[amni [1k\]: two serious mistakes by white. E3 gives up the possibility of playing a ladder breaker later around J9. and E8 forgoes the possibility of connecting under with A8.
]
;W[kf]
;B[fe]C[amni [1k\]: if the G6 ladder were still intact, L8 would have been sente

jasonmay [?\]: that's neat, I get the entire chat log
amni [1k\]: yeah, the chat is stored as part of the game record
jasonmay [?\]: don't need to make a dataninja for Go ;)

;W[eb]C[jasonmay [?\]: yeah, I noticed when sartak branched through the tree after games
]
;B[ed]
;W[da]
;B[fb]
;W[fa]C[amni [1k\]: white will live in the corner here, but black could have killed by playing e12 or d11 instead of capturing at A9
]
;B[ac]
;W[ab]
;B[cb]C[amni [1k\]: i think doing those go problems is hurting eidolos's game :(
jasonmay [?\]: unless there was a handicap, arcnae is still better than me hands down
]
;W[bb]C[jasonmay [?\]: which is understandable, he's been playing longer than me, if not by much
]
;B[ba]C[amni [1k\]: b12 is a good reply by white.
]
;W[ca]C[amni [1k\]: i think you're all three about equal, if you studied go for a week and neither of them did you'd probably be better
]
;B[ga]C[sartak [17k\]: I am a wee bastard
arcnae: yeah
amni [1k\]: white should have played G12 with sente before playing gote at C13
sartak [17k\]: hmm
amni [1k\]: which goes along with the proverb "play kikashi before living" or more generally "play sente moves before living"

;W[ad]
;B[ea]C[jasonmay [?\]: *checks out an episode of Hikaru no Go*

;W[db]C[sartak [17k\]: yep
sartak [17k\]: so, not so much a bastard as I had hoped
]
;B[ac]C[amni [1k\]: i've never seen hng, is it any good?
arcnae: I've given you enough pieces dammit
jasonmay [?\]: I dont' know
jasonmay [?\]: some dude told me about it this morning
]
;W[cd]C[jasonmay [?\]: and because I'm american, he assumed I don't read manga
amni [1k\]: almost all american players on this server came to go via hng
amni [1k\]: it's crazy, there are so many names like "hikaru3489"
]
;B[ad]C[jasonmay [?\]: I don't know if I'd like it
jasonmay [?\]: I got into Prince of Tennis only because I was on the tennis team and was serious about it
amni [1k\]: F13 is really white's only move
arcnae: I'm done
arcnae: dinner is ready, so I'm really done

sartak [17k\]: pretty good actually
