But I didn't know how to handle this.]
;W[fc]WL[473.0]

C[This exchange seemed like it didn't really benefit Black, but it benefited White by giving him a wall facing right, and also gives a forcing move later at E6 or D5.]
;B[fh]BL[292.0];W[eg]WL[378.0]

C[I didn't appreciate how vital it was that I dealt with this move appropriately.]
(;W[ie]WL[303.0]
C[I cut without realizing that my stones could now be captured in a ladder.

Instead I should have extended at H11.

There's a problem like this in Graded Go Problems for Beginners, but I didn't think of it during the game.]
;B[hg]BL[109.0]

C[Is there a good ladder breaker I can play instead of connecting here?

Maybe I should give up these two stones as well and try to get some compensation for them?]

C[Black already has two eyes, so this move feels pure gote for no benefit.]
;W[qf]WL[131.0]

C[I felt like Black let me off the hook here by playing the peep instead of the cut at B10 which lets him take the D13 stones. But he's probably more concerned about making life for his bottom left group. So this peep is fair.]

C[This was probably not that important, because if Black ignores to play C16 or C17, it hurts. I don't think I'd get enough compensation on the top center.]

C[Now that the P14 group is there, I felt better about hane rather than extend, because if he cuts I have stones to run to.

Though in reviewing here, it looks like my corner is not alive; I'd have to find a second eye on the outside, which would be difficult.]

C[This move was a mistake. It ends in gote for me, and I need sente to try to seal the bottom right group in.
