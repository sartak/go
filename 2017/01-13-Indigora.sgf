C[I played high because I had the enclosure facing me.];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn]
;B[jq];W[mq];B[qh];W[rd];B[qc];W[lc]
C[This move was annoying to deal with, so much so that I'm discouraged from playing high after my opponent approaches the orthodox 4-4.]
;B[jc]
C[So far I think this is good for Black. It's only move 19 and White has already made two weak groups.]
;W[rc];B[rb];W[pb];B[qb];W[oc];B[nc];W[od];B[pe];W[oe];B[pf]
C[I was happy at this point because now White has three weak groups in this corner.]
;W[qg];B[pg];W[rh]
(;B[qi]
C[I think I should have hane'd instead, to capture the two stones in the top right, to make my group both strong and out into the center.]
;W[ri];B[qj]
C[This does feel like I'm letting White off the hook by giving him room to live, but he's pushing from behind on the second line, which is very good for Black.]
;W[nb];B[ld];W[mc];B[md];W[kc];B[kd];W[jb];B[ib]
C[Here I hane'd because I could see that the cut doesn't work.]
(;W[kb];B[ic];W[nf];B[nh]
C[I blocked from this side because I felt that of the two groups, the right one was a little weaker, since the left one can easily connect to my corner enclosure.]
;W[mg];B[li];W[rj];B[qk];W[cg];B[ci];W[eg];B[dh]
C[I'm not sure about this move... I like it because the followup at F11 lets me get out faster.]
;W[dg];B[fi];W[ch]
(;B[dj]
C[Should I have connected solidly instead? I didn't appreciate it during the game but it looks like if we play out the obvious moves, White can take a very nice peep at C9 which works well to help seal off a large corner.]

C[Separate.];W[dd];B[de];W[cd];B[be];W[ec]
(;B[bc]
C[This move was an overplay. I can't both keep the corner and stop him from connecting his two groups.]
;W[bd]
(;B[fe]
C[Now with this move I realized I had been too greedy in trying to prevent White from taking anything, which is unreasonably optimistic. So I gave up the corner in order to keep his two groups separated, which lets me continue attacking something.]
;W[ac];B[lp]TR[pg][nh][qh:qk][fi][li][dj][fp][lp]
C[Now I'm feeling that I have a lot of stones facing the center of the board, so I'd like to turn that into territory.

I didn't realize it during the game, but I have almost no points now that White ruined my moyo in the top left. Capturing the D13 group will give me so points, but not enough for the three corners he has.

This is my best guess as to why I lose my games: whenever I can, I take the outside, but then I fail to make good enough use of it to turn it into enough points.]

C[Was playing on the bottom too passive? It didn't end well for me. It looks like playing on top would have worked just as well to prevent him from connecting.]
;W[ir];B[iq];W[gr];B[hp];W[gq]
(;B[jr];W[hs];B[fr]
C[I'm trying to seal him in, while also undercutting both of his corners. But it was a little too greedy I think, as now I can't connect my two halves. So now Black has two weak groups.]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[ho];B[io];W[go]
C[H4 isn't important so it wasn't worth saving, especially since its capture will leave a false eye.]
;B[fn];W[in];B[jo];W[dr];B[er]
C[I played this both to prevent him from connecting and also to disrupt his corner a little.]
;W[cl]
C[Now he's profiting by attacking. :(];B[fl];W[hm];B[km];W[ik];B[ii];W[jm]
;B[kl];W[gm];B[fm];W[gn]
C[Looks like he has two eyes now, but he's fairly sealed off.];B[cq]
C[I have a big wall, so invade!];W[dq];B[cr];W[ds];B[bo];W[co];B[bn];W[cp]
;B[bp];W[cs];B[br];W[bs];B[ar];W[aq];B[ap];W[bm];B[an]
C[Now I have two clear eyes, and he has no prospects for making eyes, so I can attack.]
;W[am];B[cn]
C[Cut and poke out a potential eye.];W[dm]
(;B[bj]
C[Prevent him from connecting, and reduce his potential eyespace. But it looks like I should have exploited his two cutting points at B8 and D8 first.]
;W[bk];B[ak];W[al];B[aj];W[cm];B[ck]
C[Poke out an eye.];W[dk];B[cj];W[ej]

C[Here I resigned because he's captured my dragon.

Even if the bottom left white group lived and the bottom left black group lived, it feels like I still would have been behind.]
