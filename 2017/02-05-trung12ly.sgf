C[I hate this joseki for Black. I need to learn how to cope.];B[fd];W[ee]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[hc]
C[Looks like the move to play here is F15 instead.];W[nc]
(;B[qf]
C[I'm not sure which joseki would have been best, but I liked that I come out of this with sente, and I apply pressure to Q10.]

(;B[qb]
C[This is probably too slow. But I didn't like potentially being hemmed in from both sides, because White can steal my eyespace.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[nf];W[mf];B[ng]
C[Happy to keep pushing because it weakens the R12 group.];W[rk];B[rm]
C[Taking a large corner and prevent him from growing his eyespace. Also trying not to make direct contact.]
;W[nj];B[mg]
C[Lean.];W[lg];B[mi];W[mj];B[li];W[oh]
C[This must've been an eyeshape move as it doesn't attack anything. Wouldn't getting out be better?]

C[Yeah you can cut a knight's move, but wow.]
(;B[ic];W[ie];B[je];W[if]
(;B[jc]
C[I didn't want to get cut surrounded by White.

It looks like I could have pushed one more time and still been okay, but if he cuts, the fight is violent.]
;W[fe]
(;B[gd]
C[Protecting the connection and my eyespace, while also threatening the cut.]
;W[ge]
(;B[lf]
C[Looks like this cut was a move too premature. Setting it up first would have been more severe.]
;W[kg];B[le];W[md]
C[White is now sealed in.];B[lj];W[ld];B[jf];W[jg];B[pg]
C[Taking a sente move because I was a little worried about white playing Q14.]
;W[ph];B[cj]
C[I wasn't sure how far to go. I was a little bit worried about an invasion if I went too far.]
;W[ch];B[ej]
(;W[eh];B[em]
C[Now that I have E10 and C10 I'm not worried the cut after the hane.]
(;W[fm]
(;B[fl]
C[The hane looks like it ends up with a better result for Black even with white's cut.]
;W[el];B[dm];W[gl];B[fk];W[gk];B[gj];W[fi];B[fj]
(;W[ih]
C[He's protecting against his own cut but that's a little bit simple-minded. He can at least play H12 which still does just a good a job at protecting the cut, but is more active.]
;B[hj];W[jj]
C[Stopping my two strong groups from connecting isn't that valuable.];B[gm]
;W[hm]
C[Not sure why he played the atari rather than connecting. Maybe it ends up with a better shape?]
;B[fn];W[gn];B[fm]
(;W[go]
C[Looks like he has to protect this side rather than the G9 group or risk losing the D3 group.]
;B[hl];W[im]
(;B[il]
C[I played this move reflexively and I was punished for it. I was certain this was my largest mistake in the game, which in the end isn't so bad since it's "just" poor direction. (Turns out later analysis shows an actual blunder)

Better would have been to diminish White's influence with a play at M3.]
;W[mq];B[mo];W[kp];B[jm];W[jl]
C[This cut doesn't bother me because White has plenty of defects to exploit, and Black has stones nearby.]
;B[jn];W[hn];B[jo];W[kl];B[ln];W[jp];B[ml]
C[Black effectively reduced White's moyo here at the bottom.];W[kj];B[hh]
;W[hg];B[gh];W[gg];B[fh];W[fg];B[lp];W[lq];B[ip]
(;W[iq];B[hp];W[gp];B[oc]
C[Now that all the groups are more or less sealed off, time to start poking to see where I can make profit. It's also a defensive maneuver to make sure he doesn't do the same to me first.]
;W[ob];B[kb];W[lb];B[jb];W[kd];B[mb]
C[It looked like there were enough defects here that I just plopped a stone on the board.]
;W[ma]
(;B[nb]
C[This was my blunder. I should have spent the time to read. O18 lets him capture my two stones. O19 kills.

Oh well. It's a flashcard now!]
;W[na];B[pa]
C[I should have saved this for a ko threat. Especially because the shortage of liberties means he can't hane.]
;W[mc];B[eq]
C[This was a little too optimistic. Also should have saved it for a ko threat.]
;W[ep];B[ds];W[es];B[cs];W[er];B[qk];W[qj];B[bh]
(;W[bg]
C[I can't fault him for hane-ing this way; looks like I can stir up some trouble if he were to block me from the other side.]
;B[bi];W[ql]
C[He tenuki'd away from B13, which means I can clamp later.];B[qm]

C[Why not capture the stone instead?];B[pk];W[ok];B[ol];W[nl];B[nm];W[nk]

C[It looks like S11 instead right now would have killed his group.];W[ni]
;B[bf];W[cf];B[ag];W[be];B[cg];W[dg];B[bg];W[mp];B[np]
C[The stone he atari'd isn't important; more important is protecting my territory.]
;W[nq];B[op];W[or];B[pr];W[ns]
C[I wasn't worried about the clamp because of the close-by Black stones.]

C[This was a mistake. Better to play solidly at N6 to avoid the cut.];W[mn]
