C[I wasn't sure whether to attack or to build. I figured building couldn't be wrong.

Seems Black 5 is already a strange move, appearing in very few pro games. The way to go seems to be to approach a corner.]
;B[dj]BL[47.0];W[fq]WL[26.0]
C[I approached as if it were ordinary san-ren-sei.];B[eq]BL[44.0]
C[Off to a strange start!];W[fp]WL[24.0];B[dm]BL[41.0]
C[Weird response -- I expected D6 -- but quick reading suggested D7 still protected against the attachment at D5.]
;W[jq]WL[593.0]
C[And so I took the proper extension. I considered K4 instead but I didn't like leaving my side too floatey.]
;B[oq]BL[38.0]
C[This guy's crazy!];W[pq]WL[588.0]
C[Descending to keep him out of my corner, and to try to play a hane at the head of two.]
;B[pr]BL[37.0];W[qr]WL[585.0];B[ps]BL[36.0]
C[Not afraid of this cut because I can ladder him.];W[mq]WL[573.0]
C[Take away his base, while claiming more for myself.]
(;B[nq]BL[29.0];W[mp]WL[567.0]
C[I was feeling like I'd rather seal him in small and take the outside than steal his eyes and let him run.]

(;W[po]WL[513.0]
C[I felt a little bit too weak to hane. But playing it out, it seems like it would work for me.]
;B[oo]BL[22.0];W[pn]WL[506.0]
C[I should have hane'd by now. But I guess I preferred to profit by attacking rather than trying to kill.]
;B[on]BL[21.0];W[om]WL[498.0]
C[Finally.];B[mn]BL[19.0];W[kn]WL[488.0]

C[He spent a long time considering this move. I guess he didn't want to give up his position here.]
;W[nk]WL[476.0]
C[Keep him split.];B[kl]BL[594.0];W[mk]WL[457.0]
C[I figured it'd be better to solidly march on than try to keep up with him. Plus I could potentially solidify the bottom into points.]

Maybe it would have been alright though.]

C[He needs to moves to even try to stay connected, so now to continue building a giant moyo. Even if he gets the entire left side, I'm still ahead.]

C[So much for him getting the entire left side.];B[df]BL[517.0]
