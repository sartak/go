;B[ig]C[arncaehl: what's komi?
sartak [11k?\]: It's for when there's a handicap.
arncaehl: how about this
arncaehl: what is komi?
sartak [11k?\]: One person gets a handicap, the other person gets 0.5 points
arncaehl: er?
arncaehl: komi doesn't exist in a handicap game
arncaehl: it's for an even game
sartak [11k?\]: oh
sartak [11k?\]: Well, I dunno
arncaehl: the person who strarts first has an advantage
sartak [11k?\]: oh
arncaehl: Japanese is 6.5
arncaehl: Korean is 5.5
sartak [11k?\]: So the person who goes second gets some points then
sartak [11k?\]: Maybe
arncaehl: yes
arncaehl: hence why I want to know how many free points you're getting ;)
sartak [11k?\]: ahhh
arncaehl: oh well
sartak [11k?\]: We're playing Japanese

;W[ib]C[arncaehl: how long do you want to keep playing?
arncaehl: this game is nearly over
sartak [11k?\]: If you want we can both pass and end it
arncaehl: then again, I highly doubt either of us has the skill to properly end it
arncaehl: the board is such a mess
sartak [11k?\]: :)
sartak [11k?\]: I'm pretty sure I've won
arncaehl: yeah
arncaehl: want to both pass?
sartak [11k?\]: sure
