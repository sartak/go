;W[dd]C[sartak [11k?\]: Han and mathx are interested in/players of Go
]
;B[cd]C[amni [1k\]: neat
amni [1k\]: mathx... 
amni [1k\]: is flaky
sartak [11k?\]: Yeah.. :)
amni [1k\]: :)

;W[cc]
;B[bd]
;W[dg]C[sartak [11k?\]: Was B6 a good move? I was considering C5 but I figured it wouldn't help my position much
amni [1k\]: yes, b6 is very good
sartak [11k?\]: :D
]
;B[df]C[sartak [11k?\]: OK let me go grab my dinner
amni [1k\]: c5 is another normal move there
sartak [11k?\]: ah
amni [1k\]: but b6 is probably better because c5 would be overconcentrated
]
;W[ch]C[sartak [11k?\]: Hi Han!
HanClinto: Hey guys. :)
amni [1k\]: oh shit.
sartak [11k?\]: /me is aioli
amni [1k\]: don't tell mathx we're playing here
sartak [11k?\]: heh :/
HanClinto: You already did
sartak [11k?\]: What if he joins this room :x
amni [1k\]: MATHX IS MY BEST FRIEND

;B[ce]C[sartak [11k?\]: Funny, I think I'm doing better with the lesser handicap >_>
amni [1k\]: yes
amni [1k\]: too many stones and you really can trip over them
sartak [11k?\]: :)
amni [1k\]: because attacks made against one stone are more severe against nearby ones
amni [1k\]: i.e. splitting attacks are more severe
sartak [11k?\]: ah

;W[fh]
;B[ci]C[sartak [11k?\]: \\o/
HanClinto: heh, nice, Eidolos

;W[fg]C[sartak [11k?\]: Later on you'll have to tell me why you played there
HanClinto: Prolly didn't see it
]
;B[fe]C[amni [1k\]: hm. ok
]
;W[fd]
;B[ge]
;W[gd]C[amni [1k\]: dismal position for me :/
]
;B[gh]C[sartak [11k?\]: Such is the power of the handicap!
]
;W[gf]
;B[ec]C[amni [1k\]: c6 was a good move to start with
amni [1k\]: i think.
]
;W[dc]C[sartak [11k?\]: hee

;B[db]
;W[fc]C[HanClinto: Eidolos: Why are you letting him join his forces at E6?

;B[hd]C[sartak [11k?\]: hmm
sartak [11k?\]: oops :)
]
;W[hc]C[amni [1k\]: e1 was a mistake, i should have e6 first
amni [1k\]: you should have ignored e1 and played h6
sartak [11k?\]: ah
]
;B[gb]
;W[he]C[HanClinto: Double atari.

;B[bb]
;W[eb]
;B[cb]
;W[bc]C[sartak [11k?\]: hmm, I'd say: A7 isn't the right play, B7 was just a distraction
sartak [11k?\]: so!

;B[ig]C[amni [1k\]: :)

;B[cf]C[sartak [11k?\]: Here's where you take the C1 group right? :)
amni [1k\]: i can't right away
sartak [11k?\]: ok
amni [1k\]: or wait
amni [1k\]: right i can't
amni [1k\]: because
amni [1k\]: you play e9
amni [1k\]: and then i can't connect at e7
amni [1k\]: or that whole big string has just one liberty
amni [1k\]: so it'd be a ko
amni [1k\]: but there's no threats big enough
amni [1k\]: so you'd win the ko and live on top
]
;W[ea]C[sartak [11k?\]: ok :)
amni [1k\]: so i must play e9
sartak [11k?\]: hmm
sartak [11k?\]: Yeah, A8 is dead
sartak [11k?\]: I think!
amni [1k\]: it is, because you'd need both d9 and b9 to live
sartak [11k?\]: right :D
amni [1k\]: and whichever one you take, i take the other
sartak [11k?\]: OK, so you're set up to do some good damage no matter where I play
sartak [11k?\]: though
amni [1k\]: everything except b2 is dead
sartak [11k?\]: yeah, I was trying to think how I can make G1 living but I don't see it
amni [1k\]: and b2 is... a problem for you
sartak [11k?\]: Oh hi Han
