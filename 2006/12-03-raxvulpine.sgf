;W[dd]C[sartak [?\]: Very nice work!
amni [2k\]: puppies
raxvulpine [16k?\]: Thank you!
raxvulpine [16k?\]: I thought that was pretty close, actually.
raxvulpine [16k?\]: Puppies?
sartak [?\]: Thanks for the game, sorry for keeping you from sleep. :)
raxvulpine [16k?\]: (also hi amni)
raxvulpine [16k?\]: Eh, I'll live: :)
amni [2k\]: hi there.
sartak [?\]: We should try to get more people from ##n-e to play
sartak [?\]: Just like Crawl!
amni [2k\]: Crawl?
sartak [?\]: Another roguelike.. a few NH people are playing it now.
raxvulpine [16k?\]: amni: crawl.akrasiac.org It's another roguelike. Apparently we're running a server or something. 
sartak [?\]: rax has set up a crawl+dgamelaunch server anyway.
amni [2k\]: interesting
sartak [?\]: Should give it a try sometime, it's more playful than NH.
amni [2k\]: an old one?
raxvulpine [16k?\]: I haven't actually _played_ the damn game yet :)
sartak [?\]: It's been around for a while.
sartak [?\]: It's trying to surpass ADOM as the "third" roguelike.
sartak [?\]: (the other two being of course NH and Angband)
amni [2k\]: that's good, adom needs surpassing
sartak [?\]: yes :)
raxvulpine [16k?\]: It feels kind of angbandy, looking at it, but I might be nethack-focused.
sartak [?\]: I've played a little bit of Angband.. Crawl is closer to NH.
sartak [?\]: (I find Angband to be a dreadful bore)
raxvulpine [16k?\]: "When # is a wall, I start to get nervous"
sartak [?\]: Eh, it's easy to code # walls :)
sartak [?\]: The @-centric view is nice.
sartak [?\]: Do you even know about termcast, aioli?
amni [2k\]: nope
sartak [?\]: We used it to broadcast devnull games, jsn- coded it. It's super groovy.
amni [2k\]: sorry, slow reaction, i'm in a game right now
raxvulpine [16k?\]: No, totally cool, play your game ):)
sartak [?\]: Yeah
sartak [?\]: In fact I'm gonna go watch it.
sartak [?\]: See ya! :)
