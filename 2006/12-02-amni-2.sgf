PW[amni]PB[sartak]WR[2k]DT[2006-12-02]PC[The KGS Go Server at http://www.gokgs.com/]C[amni [2k\]: in this size board, strategy is a bit more important
amni [2k\]: than just killing and living on a 9x9
sartak: A strategy vs tactics thing?
amni [2k\]: hm. do you have any questions after that?
sartak: One more game?
amni [2k\]: hm
amni [2k\]: kk
amni [2k\]: 13?
sartak: sure
]RE[W+Resign]
;B[de]C[amni [2k\]: yes, which is also to say: a global versus local thing
sartak: nod
]
;W[jd]
;B[id]C[amni [2k\]: on 7x7 or 9x9, everything is local
amni [2k\]: on 37x37, everything is global
sartak: wow
amni [2k\]: or at least, the balance is tipped towards that
amni [2k\]: 19x19 reaches a good balance between the two
]
;W[jc]C[amni [2k\]: that's why 19x19 is the most popular
]
;B[ic]
;W[ie]C[sartak: aye
amni [2k\]: it also happened here
amni [2k\]: J9 is a hane
amni [2k\]: at the head of two stones.
sartak: right
sartak: So I'd play H9?
amni [2k\]: this is advanced, but there is a rule that tells you that hane at the head of two stones is good shape.
amni [2k\]: the reason why is somewhat complicated.
amni [2k\]: i mean heuristic
amni [2k\]: not rule

;B[he]
(;W[hf]C[amni [2k\]: this style of a move is called appropriately a double hane :)

]
;W[hh]C[sartak: which move?
amni [2k\]: G5, which placed both G6 and F5 in atari
sartak: ah, so I couldn't save them both if you wanted one dead
sartak: called a fork or something in chess
amni [2k\]: usually true
amni [2k\]: yes, like that
sartak: (my chess is not much better than my go :))
amni [2k\]: unless of course, the stone placing the other two stones in atari is itself in atari
amni [2k\]: then you can simply capture it
sartak: aye

;W[le]C[amni [2k\]: in go, the basic tactical principle is
amni [2k\]: ensure that all important stones can gain life
amni [2k\]: by being able to make two eyes -- somewhere.
amni [2k\]: the basic strategy principle is
amni [2k\]: surround your opponent and try not to be surrounded -- connect your groups, and cut your opponents'
sartak: aye
amni [2k\]: a surrounded group has more difficulty making two eyes -- but that's just the beginning of why you should surround
amni [2k\]: in chinese, the name of the game is "wei-chi" which means, the game of enclosing

amni [2k\]: shape of stones is very important.

;B[hc]C[amni [2k\]: M7 was a crucial spot. if black had M7, black would live

;W[gc]C[sartak: Ah, yeah
sartak: Do games usually go on this long turnwise? I don't really see any way I can do much more.
amni [2k\]: yep, about this long
amni [2k\]: often people resign early
amni [2k\]: on a 19x19 board, usually there are 250 turns about
amni [2k\]: sometimes drastically more, in the case of ko fights
sartak: (cool, I always find it annoying when an obviously losing player is a jerk about resigning)
sartak: Ko.. the repetition of board state thing?
amni [2k\]: i don't mind, it can help someone new to see what the replies to their moves are
amni [2k\]: yep
]

(;B[cb]C[amni [2k\]: it's the name of this kind of move.
sartak: ah
amni [2k\]: D12 is at the head of this black column
amni [2k\]: hane is the japanese word for head
amni [2k\]: h9...
amni [2k\]: wait this first
sartak: sure
amni [2k\]: it's a different situation, because matters on the edge are more complicated than matters in the center
amni [2k\]: and it's even worse in the corner
amni [2k\]: much, much worse
amni [2k\]: black can play this way to defend territory to the left.
sartak: Yeah, I've noticed that (about edges anyway)
amni [2k\]: yep.
]
(;W[eb]C[amni [2k\]: now white must defend by connecting solidly.
amni [2k\]: otherwise,

(;W[cc]
;B[eb]C[amni [2k\]: black has E12
amni [2k\]: which captures D12.
]
;W[da]
;B[ea]C[amni [2k\]: it can't run to gain liberties, so it is captured.
sartak: right
amni [2k\]: so here, the presence of the edge nearby meant that E12 captured a stone.

(;W[hd]C[amni [2k\]: if the analogous situation were played
]
;B[je]C[amni [2k\]: a very important concept.
]
;W[if]TR[ig]C[amni [2k\]: white can escape in good shape
sartak: you *can* run
amni [2k\]: yep
amni [2k\]: now things would get complicated
sartak: You're gaining two liberties a turn, I can only take one away
amni [2k\]: yes, exactly!!
sartak: :D
amni [2k\]: J7 is the direction of greatest gain of liberties.
amni [2k\]: that's the technical term for "head"
amni [2k\]: if this had been played,
amni [2k\]: there are now 6 seperate strings vying for life
amni [2k\]: so a massive fight would ensue
sartak: /me nods
