sartak [11k?\]: you do
]
;B[gh]C[HanClinto [?\]: I was having a hard time remembering everything that I learned about false eyes
]
;W[gi]C[HanClinto [?\]: I probably could have done it more effeciently, but I wasn't about to have half of my pieces disappearing on me again. :)

sartak [11k?\]: I'm uh.. not gonna say :)
HanClinto [?\]: hehe

sartak [11k?\]: fool me once, etc

HanClinto [?\]: For you it does
sartak [11k?\]: well yeah :)
]
;B[ie]C[HanClinto [?\]: You were like "Nuh uh -- all I have to do is play this and that", and I just said, "Okay", even though I was just talking out the side of my mouth.
HanClinto [?\]: So I feel kind of bad about that
HanClinto [?\]: (for lying in agreement)
sartak [11k?\]: Nah don't feel bad, all's fair in love and go
HanClinto [?\]: hehe
]
;W[he]C[amni [1k\]: J5 shows good thinking, but it doesn't work here
amni [1k\]: still the J5 kind of move is very common

;W[ag]C[HanClinto [?\]: /me applauds Eidolos
sartak [11k?\]: :)
sartak [11k?\]: The game ends when we both pass in succession
sartak [11k?\]: I'm still not totally clear on how it's scored
sartak [11k?\]: We're using the Japanese ruleset, which I think just gives you credit for captures + territory surrounded
HanClinto [?\]: Oh wow. I just realized why you haven't cleared my lower-right packet of guys
HanClinto [?\]: We've got a shared double eye there.
sartak [11k?\]: Nope :)
sartak [11k?\]: Those stones are dead
HanClinto [?\]: Mine?
sartak [11k?\]: yup
HanClinto [?\]: Oh.
sartak [11k?\]: I can play J1 and G1 to capture them all
HanClinto [?\]: aaah.
sartak [11k?\]: I just haven't captured them because it'd be a wasted turn pretty much
HanClinto [?\]: right.

;B[db]C[HanClinto [?\]: Oh. I should have played E9 instead.
HanClinto [?\]: (no big deal, just a small thing)
sartak [11k?\]: D8 was the right play I think
sartak [11k?\]: well
HanClinto [?\]: E9 still connected them
HanClinto [?\]: And only increased the surrounded space
sartak [11k?\]: That territory would've been in dispute I think since I have a stone touching it
sartak [11k?\]: whereas E9 is already unquestionably yours
HanClinto [?\]: I'm not going for scoring, I'm going for annihilation. :)
sartak [11k?\]: IIRC it's called dame
sartak [11k?\]: ok :)

;W[ad]C[sartak [11k?\]: If you pass I'll pass
HanClinto [?\]: I can still play stones
HanClinto [?\]: And there's no reason why you wouldn't want to capture the 4 in the bottom right
HanClinto [?\]: I want to play this out.
sartak [11k?\]: yes but they won't really have an affect on the outcome
sartak [11k?\]: OK :)

(;W[ii]C[HanClinto [?\]: Thankyou. :)
sartak [11k?\]: hehe
HanClinto [?\]: I was hoping you would play J1 before G1.
HanClinto [?\]: That's why I wasn't passing
sartak [11k?\]: oh man
HanClinto [?\]: (in hopes that you might do that)
sartak [11k?\]: rapidfire undo
HanClinto [?\]: That's the wierd shared doulble eye thing I was talking about earlier

(;W[gi]C[sartak [11k?\]: I wouldn't call it a shared eye

;W[ii]C[sartak [11k?\]: er
sartak [11k?\]: shared double eye
HanClinto [?\]: Yeah
HanClinto [?\]: I didn't know what else to call it
HanClinto [?\]: I would have let you undo if you had seen it first. :)
HanClinto [?\]: Man, I'm shaking that game was so intense
sartak [11k?\]: Well, it's not a double eye since you aren't living
sartak [11k?\]: :)
HanClinto [?\]: Yeah, true
sartak [11k?\]: I'm annoyed with myself for letting you do that to me :)
HanClinto [?\]: hehe
