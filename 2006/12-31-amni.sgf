(;AE[df][ff][fg][gg]TR[gg][fh]C[amni [1k\]: so you need this move to prevent the connection
amni [1k\]: this is why an approach of 1 space on the third line can be seen as an attack
amni [1k\]: and is a very common move
amni [1k\]: it threatens plays on the other side that connect under, for one thing.
amni [1k\]: it aims here and here
sartak [11k?\]: white wants both?

amni [1k\]: this is more common on 19x19

amni [1k\]: er
amni [1k\]: d3

sartak [11k?\]: right, those stones are dead
