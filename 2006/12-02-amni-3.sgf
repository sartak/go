amni [2k\]: um... honestly...
amni [2k\]: i don't know
sartak: I think you can capture it if I try to play it out.
amni [2k\]: the life and death of these is very hard to read out
amni [2k\]: my guess is that black is dead there
amni [2k\]: M2 was the vital point
sartak: OK
sartak: So, carpenter's square?
amni [2k\]: one of the most complicated shapes

;B[cf]C[amni [2k\]: playing a stone such as C10

amni [2k\]: you'll learn to see that soon

amni [2k\]: there is a youtube movie of a professional go player placing 5 stones into atari
amni [2k\]: by accident
amni [2k\]: he resigned shortly after
sartak: hehe
sartak: Well I'm not sure what to do now.
amni [2k\]: B5 is the normal reply.
amni [2k\]: then I have to defend B4

sartak: ok

sartak: Any tips on how to play at this stage?
amni [2k\]: this is the endgame... it's just minor territory adjustments
amni [2k\]: endgame theory is hard
sartak: I feel like the game is already decided, I just don't know which way it'll go
amni [2k\]: you have to know a lot about miai values

sartak: Hm.
sartak: I don't know how scoring works, really.
amni [2k\]: it varies by ruleset
sartak: but I guess that territory was in dispute, yeah
amni [2k\]: the ruleset we're using right now is sucky
]
;B[jf]C[amni [2k\]: in this ruleset, your score is your territory (empty space you surround) + captured stones (1 pt each) + dead stones 
]
;W[hg]

;W[le]C[sartak: dead stones for the other color?
amni [2k\]: right, so E2 is a point for me
amni [2k\]: even if I don't explicitly capture it
amni [2k\]: in THIS ruleset anyway
amni [2k\]: i think that is confusing, after all
amni [2k\]: if I had to capture it
amni [2k\]: I would play two moves 
amni [2k\]: in my own territory
amni [2k\]: that should reduce my score by 2
amni [2k\]: so this ruleset is a bit wacky
sartak: hm

;B[ij]
;W[mh]C[amni [2k\]: yes, there is a saying

amni [2k\]: "even a moron connects against a peep"
sartak: haha
]
;B[kg]C[amni [2k\]: not sure what you mean, 7LMN
sartak: 7L, 7M, 7N
amni [2k\]: oh
sartak: Do those count for you, or are they currently worth no points to either side
amni [2k\]: they're currently worth no points
amni [2k\]: only empty spots like C1
amni [2k\]: are worth a point for me
amni [2k\]: and M7
amni [2k\]: is surrounded by both of us, so it counts for neither
amni [2k\]: it' sa neutral point
amni [2k\]: so called "dame"
]
;W[me]C[sartak: so at this stage we're just taking neutral points?
amni [2k\]: no, not at all
amni [2k\]: N9 gained a point
amni [2k\]: because now N10 is territory
amni [2k\]: if you had played N9,
amni [2k\]: I would defend at N10
amni [2k\]: and not get that point.
sartak: mm
amni [2k\]: generally when there are only neutral points left, both players pass
sartak: What about E5 and F5?
amni [2k\]: yep, those are dame as well
amni [2k\]: worthless.
sartak: ok
sartak: so what isn't dame?
amni [2k\]: there are still 3 places you can play to get a point.
amni [2k\]: L10
amni [2k\]: for subtle reasons.
amni [2k\]: J11
amni [2k\]: and C10
sartak: j11??
amni [2k\]: sure,
amni [2k\]: J10 is in atari.
sartak: I can play there?
sartak: ahh
]
;B[ic]C[sartak: I didn't know I could do that
amni [2k\]: it's ok to play a stone into a space with no liberties as long as it captures something in the process.
amni [2k\]: so you can't play at F3
sartak: right
]
;W[cd]
;B[kd]
;W[id]C[sartak: ko! :)
amni [2k\]: yep
]
;B[fi]

;B[]C[sartak: How do I know it's my territory though?
amni [2k\]: it seems that M11 is a similar case
amni [2k\]: well...
amni [2k\]: that gets kind of technical
sartak: I'm trying to differentiate F8 from M11 I guess.
amni [2k\]: i'll explain M11
sartak: ok
amni [2k\]: basically, black has the option of playing L9 at any time.
]
(;W[lc]C[amni [2k\]: i must play M11
sartak: (I forgot we had a bunch of stuff to go over)
amni [2k\]: in playing F8, you lose a point
amni [2k\]: F8 is your own territory -- empty space
amni [2k\]: in japanese rules, the most common ruleset, you only count space.
amni [2k\]: sp F8 loses a point.
amni [2k\]: so*

amni [2k\]: the M2 is the killing nakade of size 4

amni [2k\]: the triangle stones for a nakade
amni [2k\]: a killing shape
amni [2k\]: with this killing shape inside a group, it is dead
amni [2k\]: the reason is as follows,
sartak: The triangles are dead, or the surrounding group?
amni [2k\]: the surrounding group
sartak: O_o
amni [2k\]: M2 is a killing shape
amni [2k\]: it kills
amni [2k\]: not IS killed
sartak: How does it kill though?
