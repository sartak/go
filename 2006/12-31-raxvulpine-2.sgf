sartak [11k?\]: I figured you'd sac two stones for all that :)

sartak [11k?\]: We'll play again later
sartak [11k?\]: or else!
raxvulpine [9k?\]: Cool.
sartak [11k?\]: See ya.
raxvulpine [9k?\]: Thanks for the games!
sartak [11k?\]: Thank you too!
sartak [11k?\]: Always lookin' to play Go
raxvulpine [9k?\]: There's a club in Boston.
sartak [11k?\]: Hmm..
raxvulpine [9k?\]: I've never been, but it's in the same building as the chess club.
raxvulpine [9k?\]: Davis Square, Social Security building.
raxvulpine [9k?\]: I can find their schedule for you if you want it.
sartak [11k?\]: Hmm, give me a few months to stop being abysmal :)
raxvulpine [9k?\]: :P
raxvulpine [9k?\]: I bet you'd learn fast if you actually worked at it.
sartak [11k?\]: :)
raxvulpine [9k?\]: I bet I would too, but I don't have the time or money.
raxvulpine [9k?\]: (I had to give up chess lessons :( )
sartak [11k?\]: aw
raxvulpine [9k?\]: So I've been playing go instead so that I don't learn bad habits in chess.
sartak [11k?\]: Yeah I heard you were playing more.
raxvulpine [9k?\]: I don't think I'm as good as kgs thinks I am, but I can beat all of my friends now.
raxvulpine [9k?\]: I've mostly been playing in person.
sartak [11k?\]: :D
sartak [11k?\]: nod
raxvulpine [9k?\]: "I can beat Cassandra at nine stones"
sartak [11k?\]: On 19x19 right?
sartak [11k?\]: Hard to win against 9h on 9x9
raxvulpine [9k?\]: Yeah.
raxvulpine [9k?\]: aioli beat me at 9h on 9x9 once just to show off.
raxvulpine [9k?\]: But I don't think he could now :)
sartak [11k?\]: :D
sartak [11k?\]: I can almost beat him at 3h on 9x9
sartak [11k?\]: You probably could
raxvulpine [9k?\]: Do you play just 9x9?
sartak [11k?\]: Yeah.
sartak [11k?\]: For now.
sartak [11k?\]: 19x19 takes too long anyway :)
raxvulpine [9k?\]: I found that I got better as soon as I started playing 19x19.
raxvulpine [9k?\]: And it doesn't take _that_ long,.
sartak [11k?\]: huh. Maybe I'll try it again then.
raxvulpine [9k?\]: Get some Ritalin and try again :P
sartak [11k?\]: I can focus! ;_;
raxvulpine [9k?\]: :
raxvulpine [9k?\]: :)
sartak [11k?\]: The trouble is I get smashed anyway even on 9x9, but at least with 9x9 it's only a few minutes of self-loathing
sartak [11k?\]: :0
sartak [11k?\]: er
sartak [11k?\]: :)
sartak [11k?\]: Anyway, see ya. :)
raxvulpine [9k?\]: Later!

(;W[ce]C[raxvulpine [9k?\]: It doesn't get you anything.
raxvulpine [9k?\]: So I have to sac the stones.
raxvulpine [9k?\]: Good catch.
sartak [11k?\]: :)
sartak [11k?\]: I'd still lose though

;B[gg]C[raxvulpine [9k?\]: OHH
raxvulpine [9k?\]: Well, then J5
sartak [11k?\]: yeah
raxvulpine [9k?\]: Oh, but then you can play J2.
