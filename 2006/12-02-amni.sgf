amni [2k\]: 9x9 board, 6.5 komi
amni [2k\]: oh hi
sartak: asl?
sartak: ;)
amni [2k\]: black goes first, do you know the rules?
amni [2k\]: um
sartak: Well
sartak: I know the very basics.
amni [2k\]: 78 H CX
sartak: ooh
amni [2k\]: it's crazy deep, 
amni [2k\]: neat.
amni [2k\]: that's all life and death issues,
sartak: (this software is pretty good)
amni [2k\]: 9x9 isn't very useful for learning strategy
amni [2k\]: yep, it's sweet
amni [2k\]: there's even audio lecturing
amni [2k\]: i could be talking to you
sartak: Text is fine :)
amni [2k\]: but i'd wake someone up
amni [2k\]: yeah
amni [2k\]: so that all falls under L&D
sartak: Want to move to 13x13?
amni [2k\]: life and death strategy
amni [2k\]: ok
amni [2k\]: have to post a new game
sartak: ok

;B[ef]C[amni [2k\]: so here, F6 and G7 are "connected" though they aren't in the same string

;W[eg]C[sartak: But what if you put a piece onto F6?
sartak: er f7
]
;B[fg]C[amni [2k\]: then there is a sequence by which you can capture that piece

amni [2k\]: s/count//
sartak: nod, there's no way to extend that to two
amni [2k\]: nope.
amni [2k\]: when you have a space three in a row, you can make two by playing in the middle.
sartak: aye
sartak: So it seems like the only move now is resign
amni [2k\]: if you want to
amni [2k\]: then i can show you some thingz
sartak: sure
amni [2k\]: first of all,
amni [2k\]: do you want to see proof that all of the dead stones can be captured?
amni [2k\]: or do you see it?
sartak: I can see it.
amni [2k\]: kk
amni [2k\]: and also note, that white's (single) group is alive
amni [2k\]: not because it has two explicit eyes,
amni [2k\]: but because it can make two eyes given any sequence by black
sartak: Best I could do is ignore that whole group and not sacrifice more stones
amni [2k\]: which one/
amni [2k\]: ?
sartak: A1 and friends
amni [2k\]: true,
])
(;B[bd]C[amni [2k\]: makes more territory for black (on top)
sartak: Gotcha
amni [2k\]: if you have a large enough territory, it's usually certain that you can make two eyes there if challenged
amni [2k\]: though that is not always the case

sartak: Black or white to play?
amni [2k\]: black plays to save the 5 stones
amni [2k\]: (which are in danger)
sartak: (I mean whose turn)
amni [2k\]: black.
sartak: H1?
sartak: so live?
