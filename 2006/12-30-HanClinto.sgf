(;AB[fd][ee]TR[ed][fe]C[amni [1k\]: in terms of ways to join 3 stones, this way is inefficient
HanClinto [?\]: And that's bad?
amni [1k\]: in general, yeah
HanClinto [?\]: It minimizes one's liberties I suppose
amni [1k\]: it's short on liberties
amni [1k\]: yeah
amni [1k\]: and also
amni [1k\]: f5 is unnecessary to ensure connection
amni [1k\]: or is that insure
sartak [11k?\]: ensure I think
amni [1k\]: these two stones are already connected
amni [1k\]: if your opponent takes one, you can take the other
amni [1k\]: that said, the empty triangle is often the right shape, it's just not intrinsically good.
