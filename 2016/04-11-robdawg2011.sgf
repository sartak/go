C[Didn't want him to get the entire upper side.];B[fc];W[cf]
C[And I didn't want him to get the entire big corner];B[bd];W[ci]
C[Makin' a base.];B[ff];W[ge]
C[If he's going to jump out, I wanted to squeeze him to build out my two sides.]
;B[fe];W[gd]
C[I don't hate this move because it squeezes and builds up my upper side. It also forces black to either overconcentrate or leave a defect.]
;B[fd];W[mc]
C[Taking the side.];B[qg];W[qi]
C[At this point I decided I want to take the entire lower half of the board for myself, so I played moves to build up a wall.]
;B[og];W[ql]
C[I was considering playing around A but I decided better to make a base and aim for the corner, as A would invite a move around 2.]
LB[ni:A];B[pg]
C[Pointless!];W[jp]
C[Taking a big point. I didn't want to play around A because I feel like then black would play at 22 and so much for my plan.

I really like white's position here. Black is overconcentrated in two corners, whereas white is spread out across the rest of the board.]
LB[ji:A];B[hg];W[kg]
C[I wasn't truly threatening to cut or connect (since all these groups could easily make life) but I did want to apply pressure and start to build a horizontal wall along the center of the board.]
;B[if];W[ie]
C[I didn't want my two stones on the left to get cut off. Also attacks these stones.]
;B[jf];W[kf];B[mf];W[mg]
C[Building up that wall!];B[mh]
C[Aw.];W[lh];B[ng]
C[This move gives me an opportunity to fix shape.];W[lg];B[mi];W[gh];B[gg]
;W[ni]
(;B[oi]
C[I think blocking from the bottom would have been better; it would have given black more thickness to erase my moyo.]
;W[nj];B[nh];W[lj]
C[Sealed in black's incursion.];B[ii];W[ih]
C[I played on this side of his stone because I didn't want it to be too obvious what I was doing!]
;B[hh];W[gi];B[hi];W[ji];B[ik]
C[So much for my plan.];W[jj];B[hj];W[gk]
C[Trying to crunch black into a line which would give me two walls.];B[eh]
;W[ei]
C[I decide to sacrifice the points and the one stone to build up a wall.]
;B[dh];W[di];B[fi];W[fj];B[fh];W[gj];B[cg];W[bg]
C[I suppose I don't have to sacrifice that stone after all.];B[bh];W[ch]
;B[dg];W[bf];B[cd]
C[Another move wasted on connecting a one-space jump O_O];W[hk];B[ij];W[il]
;B[jk];W[jl]
C[Building up the wall looks real nice right now.];B[kk];W[lk];B[li];W[ki]
;B[kj]
C[I didn't need to cut but it was easy.];W[kl]
C[NOW WE'RE TALKIN!];B[ke];W[le];B[nd];W[me]
(;B[ne];W[je];B[hb];W[ib];B[gc];W[hc]
C[Just lots of blocking out some eyespace for myself.];B[hd];W[id];B[ic]
;W[he];B[hc];W[kc]
(;B[pj]
C[Now that he sees I can easily make two eyes he finally tenukis.

Better would have been to take advantage of my weak two stones first, though, I think.]
;W[oj];B[pi];W[qj];B[pk];W[ol];B[pl];W[om];B[pm];W[qm];B[pn];W[qn]
C[Pushing downward from both sides because I can afford to; the territory on the right side ain't nothin. Black's not really gaining anything with this incursion other than a tiny reduction of my half-the-board's worth of points.]
;B[oo];W[po];B[on];W[op]
C[I've got so much wall it's crazy.];B[nm]
(;W[nn]
C[This cut was an overplay.];B[nl];W[ok];B[mj];W[mk];B[ll];W[ml];B[nk];W[mm]
;B[mn]
(;W[lm]
C[I had to capture because I was in atari; plus, extending from my own stone in atari would have invited black to get stronger.]
;B[no];W[ln];B[lo];W[ko];B[lp];W[jq]
C[I played here because playing the empty triangle would have been weird and inefficient.]
;B[lq];W[fq]
C[That move doesn't threaten to come into my territory, so tenuki! Just trying to avoid a 3-3 invasion.]
;B[cm]
C[Finally the invasion begins. But he's out of luck; no matter which direction he runs, he runs into me.]
;W[cn];B[ck];W[bi];B[dl];W[bm];B[bl]
C[Building a ponnuki without a capture seems odd, but ok.];W[bn];B[dn];W[em]
C[Blocking the double ponnuki.];B[el];W[fm];B[fl];W[gl];B[ej]
C[I have nothing to fear from your cut, my liberties are boundless.];W[ek]
;B[dj];W[cj];B[bk];W[dk];B[dm];W[eo];B[aj];W[ai];B[bj];W[en];B[dj]
C[Okay, playing into atari is just silly.];W[ej];B[fk];W[rg]
C[I tenuki because even with another move it's obvious there's no way he can make two eyes now. This seems like a pretty big point on the board.]
;B[rf];W[rh];B[qh];W[mr]
C[I got another big point!];B[mq];W[nq];B[kp];W[jo]
C[I have to respond but it doesn't worry me.];B[np];W[or]
C[I decide to play it extra super safe since I'm quite comfortably in the lead; don't want to blow it!]
;B[lr];W[kr];B[ks];W[js];B[ls];W[ob]
C[I regain sente for a third big point in a row.];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[nb]
;B[nc]
C[This move is pretty much worthless.];W[sf];B[re];W[se];B[sd];W[ri]
C[I got a little greedy, definitely, but at least I didn't suffer a connect-and-capture.]
;B[sg];W[sh];B[sf];W[jg];B[nf]
C[This response surprised me as it's an unrelated gote move.];W[ig]
C[Double sente move.];B[hf];W[df];B[ef];W[de];B[ed];W[ad]
C[I'm kind of a bastard.];B[bc];W[ac];B[ab];W[ae];B[bb];W[lf];B[be]
C[Better would be to save this as a ko threat.];W[af];B[ia];W[jb];B[ja];W[ka]
;B[ha]
C[Gote.];W[qk]
C[Gote but important.];B[pa];W[oa];B[qa];W[mb]
C[This one was sente since I have to protect.];B[md];W[ld];B[ce]
C[He filled a dame.];W[kq]
C[I fill a ko.];B[ms];W[nr];B[ns];W[os];B[ee]
C[He filled what looks like dame but now I'm in atari.];W[ah];B[gf]
C[I couldn't play this because of a shortage of liberties.];W[kd];B[];W[]
