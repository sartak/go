C[I played the most common (44%) response. Yay!

My thinking was his stone is further away so I can be more influence-oriented.]
;B[gn]
C[Not a very common move.];W[qn]
C[Most common response (67%) again was tenuki. I'm nailing these joseki!]
;B[pn];W[pm]
C[I was considering the 3-3 invasion but turns out I once again played the best move. My thinking was if he's gonna attach I have no other move.]
;B[oo]
C[We've now left pro game territory. I did think this move was odd since it invites the peep.]
;W[qo];B[po]
C[Which he accepted.];W[qk]
C[Now make a base for my stones. I didn't want to risk playing another line further because of the cut at R7.

The other move I was thinking was P7 because I'm a little worried with the box he's made.]
(;B[qh];W[nc];B[qc]
C[This seems a bit meek; doesn't put any pressure on my stone.];W[kc];B[md]
;W[nd]
C[Of course I'm going to split! I was hoping the shoulder hit would let me build up some strength to then attack R12.]
;B[ne]
C[While I love me some shoulder hits for sure, I don't think hane is the response.]
;W[mc]
C[I want to build solidly so I can attack all these disconnected stones.]
;B[le];W[fc]
C[Really not sure why I played here.];B[id]
C[This move seems sketchy, since…];W[ld]
C[I can take some forcing moves…];B[me];W[ke]
C[And now J16 is too close to my strength.];B[jd];W[kd]
C[The peep doesn't help much.]
(;B[dj]
C[This move is one line too low.];W[dh]
C[I played from this side because he doesn't have a two-space extension downwards.]
;B[el]
C[I guess he's connecting to his other two stones. Sure. Leaving it for now for possible attack later.]
;W[if]
C[Now to make trouble with these two stones.];B[ih]
C[Looks like he decided to sacrifice them?];W[gh];B[hf]
C[I have a lot of friends nearby so cutting is no problem.];W[hg];B[ig];W[jf]
C[Since we were in a crosscut of sorts, extend the weaker stone. Being strong is all I need to get ahead here, since he's cut into four groups.]
(;B[kf]
C[Not sure why he tried to cut a diagonal.];W[kg];B[lf];W[jg]
C[I was happy with this exchange, since not only did he fail to seal in, he also got split.]
;B[ij]
C[And so his moyo expands…];W[oe]
C[But before dealing with that, here I decide his N15 group's shape is looking pretty sad, so perhaps I can attack, perhaps even capture, it.]
;B[of];W[pe];B[od];W[pf];B[og];W[mg]
C[Playing the shape move to try to cut.];B[nf];W[pg];B[ph]
C[I sure didn't appreciate how annoying Q12 would be to deal with. It leads to a capturing race favorable for Black.]
;W[oh];B[nh];W[oi];B[mh]
(;W[lg]
C[I played this move because I knew giving up my N13 stone let black evade capture... but see the variation. I think I can still seal black in by sacrificing N13!]
;B[ng];W[qg];B[rh];W[ki]
C[Here this helps me jump out but also puts pressure on the black dragon.]
;B[kj]
C[I'm letting him moyo harder and harder >_<];W[ji]
C[I didn't want to get cut and killed so a bamboo joint seemed more prudent than a hane. Plus it's a double peep.]
;B[jj];W[ii]
C[Poking at the peep he didn't connect.];B[mj]
C[Now it's his turn to jump out to avoid getting sealed in.];W[mi]
C[I play a wedge since I have support on both sides.];B[ni];W[nj]
C[But this was an overplay.];B[oj]
C[Now my position is decimated.];W[nk];B[hh];W[gg];B[hi]
(;W[je]
C[Here I decide to play a purely defensive move because my most recent cut didn't work out so well.]
;B[nm]
C[Here he's trying to turn potential into cash. Before I can abide that though I must first take some forcing moves to flex my muscles.]
;W[ok];B[pj];W[mk];B[li]
C[Now I'm in much better shape to reduce.];W[lm];B[ln];W[km]
C[Here he promptly resigned. I asked why, since it was very much still a game, but he left.]
