TM[300.0]OT[5x20 byo-yomi];B[pd]BL[296.7]
C[I'm playing as white, against a KGS player of completely unknown rank.]
;W[dp]WL[298.1];B[dd]BL[291.7];W[pp]WL[296.0];B[qn]BL[280.3];W[nq]WL[291.8]
;B[rp]BL[278.1];W[qq]WL[289.5]
C[This was a lucky guess at the correct joseki move on my part. I'm not sure how much of it was it being the "obvious" move versus me having seen it played before.]
;B[pk]BL[275.6];W[kp]WL[259.9]V[17.5]
C[I played this move one line too high, it should have been at A. But according to the joseki dictionary, playing at B is perhaps more common. I didn't think I'd have room to form a base if I played in that area.]
LB[kq:A][qi:B];B[kq]BL[267.5]
C[And sure enough black plays in the right spot!];W[jq]WL[254.7];B[jp]BL[264.1]
;W[lq]WL[252.6]
C[Ordinarily I wouldn't have been so aggressive, but I had a strong local position.]
;B[kr]BL[259.3];W[jr]WL[251.0]
C[I descended from this side (rather than A) to avoid the atari. Playing the other side leads to a very different result (since it strengthens me in the SE corner a lot).]
LB[lr:A];B[lp]BL[252.9];W[ko]WL[249.2];B[mq]BL[250.6];W[lr]WL[247.5];B[mr]
BL[247.5]
C[I guess he really wanted the corner, since he's forcing me to take the marked stones and thereby gaining a lot of leftward-facing influence. I should have been more willing to sacrifice that corner for lots more influence.]
TR[kq:kr];W[ks]WL[243.8]
(;B[np]BL[245.1]
(;W[lo]WL[242.2];B[mp]BL[237.6];W[on]WL[219.0]
C[I like this move primarily because I think I'da been real mad if black had played it (which is my usual barometer). It offers an escape route to my white corner, as well as menaces to cut black's two groups.]
;B[oo]BL[234.5]
C[He won't have none of that though. It's interesting to note in this game he eventually does connect. Maybe if I played better he wouldn't have been able to.]
(;W[po]WL[216.2];B[nn]BL[232.2]LB[pn:A]
C[Nice move by black. I probably would have reflexively played at A. But then white's extension to 29 sure makes A look like it consigned the six stones to die.]
;W[om]WL[213.4]
C[This invites the cut at A, but black was looking weak, so I wanted to keep the pressure on. Black escapes easily if I played A.]
LB[pn:A];B[pn]BL[221.8]
(;W[op]WL[198.9]
C[Strenghtening my corner while also making black heavier. I like this move.]
;B[no]BL[218.5]
(;W[nm]WL[197.3]
C[From playing out some variations (A-E), 34 as played seems to give white the best results.]
LB[nl:A][ml:B][ll:C][mm:D][lm:E];B[mn]BL[216.3]
(;W[lm]WL[192.4]
C[I think this was an overplay. By pushing at A one more time, the marked group would be able to survive the onslaught that comes next, and I could have captured the large black group. If I played perfectly. Maybe.]
LB[mm:A]TR[nm:om][on];B[ln]BL[205.5];W[kn]WL[190.9]LB[km:A]
C[38 really should have been at A, since black immediately takes advantage of an atari on the single stone above 37. I have a bad habit of unthinkingly blocking directly rather than squelching progress by casting a net.]
;B[mm]BL[203.5]
(;W[ml]WL[190.1];B[ll]BL[201.0];W[km]WL[189.2]
C[Yep, I ended up being forced to play the move I should have played! I brought what comes next upon myself.];B[nl]BL[198.9]
(;W[mk]WL[187.8];B[ol]BL[196.9];W[nr]WL[91.9]
C[At this point, now that black escapes, I decide to ensure that I make life in the corner. If nothing else, this move forced black to play a worthless response, and it's *much* better that I play here before he does, so I am happy with this move.]
;B[ms]BL[193.2]
(;W[rq]WL[76.2]LB[qp:A]
C[This should have been at A instead since it blocks black much better. It invites black to play A.]
;B[qp]BL[190.7];W[qo]WL[71.5]
C[This was worthless. Better would have been something like A to assuage my concerns about making life.]
LB[pr:A];B[ro]BL[188.4];W[rn]WL[55.9]
C[Awful move. It's a sacrifice on my part to force black toâ€¦fix his own defects.]
;B[rm]BL[185.8];W[qm]WL[41.7]
C[About the only nice thing I can say about this move is that it forces black to respond to it, rather than letting him shred me up elsewhere.]
;B[pm]BL[181.5]
(;W[ql]WL[40.7]
C[Pointless terrible move. Black rightly ignored it. I think I would have saved the corner if I didn't waste it here. My corner is vulnerable.]
;B[pq]BL[168.3];W[oq]WL[39.3];B[pr]BL[165.8]
C[And now I cannot evade capture.]

TW[hh:hs][jh:js][gi:gs][ii:is][ki:ks][cj:fs][ak:bs][lk:lm][mk:ml][lo][lq:lr]
C[Black wins by my resignation. The algorithmic scoring still has me ahead by 24.5 points thanks to the massive wall I built, but I was disheartened by losing thirteen stones, the entire corner, and probably the entire right-hand side.]
