C[Already off to a bad start, I played in the wrong corner!];W[qq];B[dp]
C[I wonder if A would have been better because of 2?]LB[dq:A];W[qd];B[oc]
C[I'm not sure how to attack the 3-4 point. According to joseki dictionary this is the most common approach.]
;W[mc];B[kc]
C[Pincer seemed reasonable at the time. According to joseki, A would have been a better  play. But it did start to build up the top side for me.]

C[Making a base.];W[qc];B[mf]
C[Cutting off the lone white stone. A one-space extension at A would have been more severe.]
LB[me:A];W[oe];B[nd]
C[Cut.];W[ld];B[md];W[lc];B[kd];W[le];B[kf];W[me];B[ne];W[of];B[nf]
C[I'm happy with this exchange. White's group ended up being captured, and I would have even ended up with the corner too if it weren't for blunders.]

C[Trying to avoid capture by directing play towards my lower stone.];W[pf]
;B[qe];W[qh];B[rh];W[qi];B[ri];W[pj];B[qk];W[pk];B[rl]
C[I'm not sure how I feel about this. If I can eventually cut at A then I'm really happy. But then again B is really vulnerable too.]

C[Trying to block from making a base.];W[cl];B[el]
C[Capping.];W[dm];B[en]
C[Not sure if I like this move. Similar to 17.];W[em]

C[I'm very happy to have captured.];W[co];B[bo];W[cp];B[cq];W[bp];B[ap]
C[At this point I was pretty happy with this game so far. I'd captured several decent sized groups, and the fact that the ladder got as far as it did made me feel like I was a stronger player than my opponent. Little did I knowâ€¦]
;W[ir];B[hr]
C[Gotta defend the peep. White must have played this to start to develop his corner.]
;W[mq];B[pl]
C[Atari'ing the other way would have worked much better for me. As it stands I cut myself.]
;W[qm];B[pm];W[rm]
C[Yeah. Ouch.];B[sk];W[pn];B[on];W[po];B[np]
C[Trying to reduce. But there's too much white influence here, and my stones are  weak as it is. So I should have reinforced them first before reducing.]
;W[oo];B[nn];W[no];B[mo];W[mp];B[ln]
C[I don't know why I played so many self shoulder hits!];W[lo];B[mn];W[ko]
;B[jq];W[kn]
C[I should have played 102 instead of 101, but I didn't want to be pushing from behind into another white group. This move kills my black stones.]
;B[km];W[lm];B[kl]
C[This is the move when I noticed I was in trouble, and where it all started to go visibly downhill for me. Even if I play 105 elsewhere I don't see a way to save my stones.]
;W[ml];B[nl];W[nk];B[ok];W[nm];B[ol];W[oj];B[nj];W[mk];B[ni]
C[I still have designs to capture the white stones up here.];W[nh];B[mh]
;W[mi];B[mj];W[li];B[ng];W[oh];B[oi];W[pi];B[lj];W[kj];B[lk];W[om];B[ll]
C[On first review I figured this was a wasted move, as 9 and A are miai, but it does turn out to be useful as it forces white to throw away a move too, to reinforce my position with no downsides. Not so bad.]

C[I don't know why I set myself up for these problems.];W[kh];B[ji];W[jh]

C[At this point I desired to capture the white group here.];W[je];B[jf];W[if]
;B[ke];W[he];B[jd];W[ie];B[gf];W[ge];B[fe];W[fd];B[ff];W[ec]
C[At this point I certainly knew the chance to capture was over. But on the plus side, I gained influence and all white got was a long chain of stones.]
;B[gd];W[gc];B[hd];W[id]
C[I should have already seen that the two stones were as good as captured by now.]

C[Again this was a wasted move as I could have connected in response to pressure, and so I should have worried more about attackin.]
