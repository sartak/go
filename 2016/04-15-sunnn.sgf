C[sartak: hello :)
];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp]
(;W[dd]
C[I considered approaching directly at A but decided to play it safe.]LB[op:A]
;B[oq]
C[And sure enough his response was about where I expected it.];W[qf];B[nc]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]
C[Mmm, joseki.];B[fq];W[cn]
C[I laughed about this because I wondered what it would look like for two double-digit kyu players who only know this joseki to play it out in all four corners.]
;B[jq];W[ci]
C[I wasn't sure whether to play on this side or the top, nor where exactly to play on this side.]
;B[ic]
C[Seeing this I'm a bit happier with my move being on the third line.];W[qm]
C[Nice peaceful game so far.];B[fn]
C[I'm never quite sure how to deal with this move… (or when to play it myself…)]
;W[fc]
C[…so I tenuki'd.];B[cm]
C[I guess he wasn't happy with my tenuki.];W[dm]
C[I think black was a little greedy so I blocked.];B[cl];W[dl];B[ck];W[dk]
C[I was fine pushing because it would run black into my stone. Plus I knew my response if he pushed up one more time would be A not B. And I was pretty certain I'd surround him and he wouldn't have space to make two eyes.]
LB[di:A][dj:B];B[bn];W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[cq]
C[Breaking my ponnuki I guess.];W[cp];B[dq]
(;W[cf]
C[Instead of tenuki I should have kept the pressure on. I don't see a way for black to live. But I guess I must have assumed he was already dead.

I think this is ultimately the move that cost me the game, because it let black live!]
;B[cj];W[di]
C[I was eager to play this move, it feels like better shape than I used to make (playing the extension up from the other group instead)]
;B[dj];W[ej];B[ek]
C[This move really punishes my tenuki.]
(;W[el];B[fk];W[fl]
C[I have no choice but to push from this side. I'm not sure if I realized it during the game but my group would be in big trouble if I didn't.]
;B[en]
C[Black must be sensing that I will die, so he is enlarging my loss, while also strengthening himself for the kill.]
;W[dn];B[gk];W[gl];B[ei];W[fj];B[fi];W[gj];B[hk]
(;W[hi]
C[I played here because I knew my three stones were dead if I didn't play locally.

I picked 50 over an extension to not get sealed in.]
;B[hl]
(;W[hm]
C[At this point I don't think I could have saved my group, regardless of where I play 52.]
;B[gm];W[gn];B[fm]
(;W[go];B[ep]
C[I spent a great deal of time thinking about my response to this.

Obviously, trying to connect directly just fails.]
(;W[im]
C[I ended up deciding to put more pressure on the stones that are surrounding me, since if I can capture them I probably win.]
;B[hj];W[gi];B[jk]
C[Even in the few days between playing and reviewing this I've come to appreciate this move a lot more, from other games.]
;W[ik]
C[I guess I went for it anyway to see what happens when black has that vital extra liberty.]
;B[ij];W[ii];B[jj];W[mp]
C[Not sure what I was thinking other than "just tenuki".];B[io];W[km];B[hn]
;W[in];B[ho];W[jo];B[ip];W[jp]
C[I'm okay sacrificing the two stones for this exchange, I've now got strength from which to attack.]
;B[gp];W[iq];B[fo];W[kq];B[jr];W[ir];B[kr]
(;W[lq];B[lr];W[mr];B[hq]
C[I was surprised this didn't work. I guess it's because the marked stone takes away a necessary liberty.]
TR[ip]
(;W[or]
C[So I tenuki. This was an overplay though.];B[nq]
C[This peep forces me to connect or lose both stones.];W[mq];B[nr];W[pr]
;B[ns]
C[Cut.];W[rq]
C[This was me trying to live in the corner I guess. Didn't go so well.];B[rp]
;W[pp]
C[Another overplay as I can't quite make it to the corner.];B[pq];W[op]
C[Black is starting to look short on liberties though.];B[np];W[no];B[qq]
;W[qo];B[pm]
C[Ooh, now there might be something here. This black stone is very much surrounded by white thickness. So if I can drive him downward into that, away from his crane's nest shape, I should be able to make profit.]
;W[pl];B[ql]
(;W[pn];B[ol];W[pk];B[nl];W[mk]
C[Here I'm trying to stop him from connecting.];B[ml];W[lk];B[ll];W[kl]
C[Good! I think I've sealed black in.];B[on];W[oo];B[nn];W[mo];B[oj];W[ok]
;B[nk];W[nj]
C[Now if I can just keep everything alive, he won't be able to make two eyes and that'll be real swell.]
;B[pj];W[qk];B[mj];W[ni];B[kk]
C[Black is feeling a little like a caged tiger attacking the bars.];W[lj]
;B[mi];W[li];B[mh]
C[So far so good. His defects get in the way of him capturing any of my stones.]
;W[ji];B[ki]
(;W[kh];B[lh]
C[WELP.

I guess I got greedy and wanted to capture his cutting group. I need to be better about spotting my own weaknesses!]
;W[nh]
C[Trying to build up strength so I don't lose the entire side too.];B[ln]
C[I'm not sure what black was thinking when he made this move. Maybe if I had tenuki'd he could have exploited some weakness, but I don't see it.]
;W[ko];B[gd]
C[His own tenuki surprised me a little.];W[fh]
C[The ladder works :) Just trying to clear out some aji. And it's local enough.]
;B[gc];W[fb]
C[Going for the corner!];B[kg];W[jh];B[jg];W[ig];B[if];W[hf]
C[I'm trying to play in such a way that I maintain my corner. But this game has been going remarkably badly for me, I don't think a single fight as gone in my favor.]
;B[hg];W[gg];B[hh]
C[I'm not sure why black descended here. Maybe to threaten the capture. But he'd have to get two more moves in a row to pull that off. :/]
;W[gh];B[he];W[gf];B[jf]

C[Trying to establish a foothold and erase some moyo by attacking a defect.]
;B[lg];W[mf];B[ng];W[nf];B[og]
C[The cut seems a little ridiculous since I have the two stones in his way but I guess my three stone group is hurting enough that it works to capture it.]
