C[This was a blitz game.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[dj]
C[I always feel a little awkward about only playing the star points.];B[jp]
;W[nc];B[kd];W[pb]
C[This wasn't quite the right move; better according to joseki dictionary would have been A.]
LB[qc:A];B[nd];W[qc]
C[Taking the corner since he didn't defend it. But this is not the right move again, more common response is to jump back.]
;B[qd];W[rd]
C[Trying to make eyespace and reduce his side.];B[re];W[rc]
C[Protecting the obvious defect.];B[mc]
C[He's closing me in.];W[mb];B[oc]
C[This move exposed defects in my shape for sure.];W[nb]
(;B[fq]
C[I was surprised he didn't continue attacking and instead tenuki'd. Maybe because blitz, he wanted to play easier moves to give himself time to read the developed corner? (I guess not much reading is required; see variants)]
;W[cn];B[qo];W[pc]
C[I wanted to play it safe because I know I often leave weak groups around.]
;B[qf]
C[I was glad to see he played a relatively slow move in response, rather than ignoring.]
;W[fc];B[be]
C[His playing on the second line felt strange, but I suppose it is the second-most common response.]
;W[bd]
C[I'm glad to see I did play the top response.];B[ed]
C[This is an uncommon followup.];W[ec]
C[I'm happy to take another corner.];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce]
(;W[de]
C[This was an overplay. I should have defended my second-line stone.];B[bc]
C[He punished my overplay.];W[ic]
C[Trying to make my side bigger and reduce his potential.];B[cb];W[dc];B[bb]
;W[dg]
C[I was fine trading the corner for influence because I'm concerned about all the potential he has.]
;B[fo]
C[I'm never sure how to deal with jumps up like this (nor when I should myself)]
;W[lc]
C[I tenuki'd to play a couple forcing moves to solidify territory on the top of the board.]
;B[md];W[kc];B[ld];W[jd];B[kf];W[fm]
C[Now I respond :) One-point jump seems as good an answer as any.];B[gm]
;W[fn];B[gn];W[gl];B[hl];W[gk];B[im]
C[I'm a bit surprised by this move.  I guess he's defending the cut.];W[jj]
C[I wanted to invade because he has the entire center. This was probably too deep.]
;B[hk];W[hj]
C[Hane and one-space jump. I like it.];B[gj]
(;W[fj]
C[I think I cut the wrong way.];B[ij];W[hi];B[ii];W[hh];B[ih];W[jg]
C[I'm not sure what I was trying to do with this move. I'm going to blame it on it being blitz.]
;B[ig]
(;W[kg]
C[Also, not sure why I extended this way instead of up towards my stones.]
;B[jf];W[mg];B[lh]
(;W[ng]
C[Why did I extend instead of connecting? I guess I was worried about becoming too heavy. But... I'm committed.]
;B[lg];W[ph]
C[Jumping out to try to get to a side.];B[ni];W[pi]
C[I flounder around here for a while but I have no chance to live, and there are seemingly no defects for me to exploit. Black has trounced me. At no point in the game did I have any sort of advantage.]
