C[Playing this side because it's bigger.];B[pp];W[dp]
C[I should learn some 3-4 joseki so I could've played D3 instead.];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[id];W[qn];B[ql];W[rp]
C[I now know the correct response for what I was trying to do is R3. (Only a month later and I'm already baffled I played S4. Progress!)]
;B[pn];W[qq]
C[Which I eventually play anyway so that's good.];B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[qr]
;B[oq];W[po];B[oo];W[qo];B[pm];W[rl];B[rk];W[rm];B[qm];W[rn];B[qk]
C[This is not joseki haha. I definitely did not play well here. I gave black a gigantic wall in exchange for about twelve points of territory.]
;W[dj]
C[I'm not sure where I'd play nowadays. Probably at K3 to try to neutralize the wall]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[cn];W[en]
C[Better response is probably at E5.];B[cq]
C[My joseki game is weak.];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[co];W[cr];B[br];W[dr];B[bq]
C[This actually doesn't look too far off from joseki I've since looked at.]
;W[kq]
C[Probably not the most important thing to be playing right now.];B[md]
C[Good tenuki by black.];W[je]
C[Shoulder hit to establish a foothold in his moyo.];B[jd];W[ke];B[kd];W[qf]
C[Invasion!];B[rf]
C[I don't think this is the right move. S15 instead?];W[qg];B[rg];W[qh];B[rh]
;W[qi]
C[I was so happy making this exchange, he's getting second-line territory and I'm building out much-needed influence and strength.]
;B[od];W[hd]
C[Trying to build up more outside influence by poking at weak points.];B[hc]
;W[gd];B[gc];W[le];B[ld]
C[Now I'm feeling like I have more potential than he does!];W[nl]
C[Reduce.]
(;B[on]
C[I suppose he was justified in fearing the cut, since it would be pretty severe.]
;W[np]
C[And so I take advantage with a severe peep to continue neutralizing the wall.]
;B[op];W[mn]
C[Don't want to get cut, also, his wall is looking not very effective now.]
;B[ok]
C[Now he's trying to cut me I think, or at least trying to escape with his wall.]
;W[nk];B[oj]
C[Good response.];W[oi]
C[I'm trying to squeeze him between my two groups, and also avoiding getting sealed in with my four white stones on the right.]
;B[nj];W[ni];B[mj];W[pj]
C[This is probably a slow move since I can't cut anyway.]
(;B[ri]
C[But luckily he plays nonsense in return. Even if I do manage to cut him below, he can crawl up to his corner.]
;W[ol]
C[Since I now have my free move, mise well take it.];B[pk];W[kj]
C[Now to attack this (currently) eyeless dragon!];B[li]
(;W[mi]
C[This was a slow move that just helped him get stronger, but I suppose I was worried about my group. M12 would have worked better.]
;B[lj];W[lh];B[ki];W[kh];B[ji];W[jj];B[ii];W[ig]
C[Trying to play further away. This also connects my groups up.];B[ij]
C[I'm fine letting him push me around because he's just crawling while I'm making solid territory.]
;W[jl];B[jk];W[kk];B[ik];W[km]
C[Fixing.];B[gj]
C[He plays the shape point.]
(;W[fj]
C[I don't think this is a good move. I'd probably play around H7 nowadays.]
;B[fi];W[gi]
C[Cross-cutting with so much black strength nearby is not a good idea.];B[gh]
C[And indeed he takes advantage.];W[gk];B[hi];W[ec]
C[Free move to help build friendly stones, since it's looking like his dragon is going up towards this corner..]
;B[eb];W[hl]
C[Now to try to seal him off more.];B[il];W[im];B[hk];W[gl];B[ej];W[fk];B[ei]
;W[ek];B[di];W[cj];B[bk]
(;W[cl]
C[I think B7 would have been better, since B9 sure feels like a black overplay. I should have punished.]
;B[bl];W[cm];B[bm]
C[Sealing him and while I also take basically the entire bottom half of the board.]
;W[bj]
(;B[ck];W[dk];B[eg];W[fd]
C[At this point I'm not going to be making many points on the upper half of the board; it's all dame. So I think at this point the goal is to avoid dying which would give him the game.]
;B[dc]
C[Taking this atari does nothing for black…];W[ed]
C[…but makes white stronger, so it wasn't a very good idea.];B[ie];W[if]
;B[he];W[gf]
C[Netting him in. Turns out this was a little too optimistic.];B[of]
C[This was an overplay.];W[qe]
C[Time to cause some trouble.];B[re]
C[There's no reason to play here since I can't cut on both ends. But I'm sure glad he responded.]
;W[oe]
C[I played here since either nobi would also be a peep.]
(;B[ne];W[pe];B[pd];W[nf];B[me];W[mf]
C[Now I'm not worried about making two eyes.];B[jh];W[jg];B[hf];W[hg];B[ge]
(;W[ff]
C[I was worried that if I block he would cut, but both my groups are pretty safe.]
;B[fe]
(;W[ef]
C[Ditto.];B[ee];W[de]
C[Now I blocked since there's no cut.];B[ci];W[bh]
C[If I were playing this now I would have tenuki'd since the bottom is much bigger.]
;B[gg];W[mr];B[fg]
C[Playing his free move to get a couple points of territory.];W[df];B[dg]

C[Fixing immediately loses points. But I guess it means he keeps sente, so that may be worth it.]
