C[I've really gotta learn some 3-4 joseki. I feel lame playing 4-4s every game.]
;B[ec];W[jc]
C[This move is almost exactly one from Graded Go Problems.];B[mc]
C[I think M17 would have been better? Though that does leave the potential for an invasion at O17.]
;W[gc]
C[Make a base.];B[fb];W[gb]
C[Shape move.];B[kc];W[kd]
C[I could have played K16 I suppose but the hane seemed more severe.];B[ld]
;W[ke];B[le];W[kf]
C[I was hoping he'd play M14 so I could hane again, but he tenuki'd. Which means I could later play M14 and be very happy.]
;B[qn];W[ql]
C[I decided to pincer to either get a wall facing my D4 stone, or build up a solid amount of territory on the bottom.]
;B[qq];W[pq]
C[Blocked this way to develop the bottom side.];B[qp];W[po]
C[After I played this I worried that the right move was Q6 instead, but no! I played the move 100% of pro games in this situation have played. Phew.]
;B[pn];W[qo]
C[Again I played the pro move. Phew!];B[ro];W[on]
C[Oops. This is not joseki, not the pro move. Better to hane the bottom, or cut at S4.

But I was thinking I am happy to sacrifice my R8 stone to get an even bigger wall.]
(;B[rm]
C[This move surprised me though I guess he's protecting the cut. Seems too passive.]
;W[rl]
C[Which is why I punished by blocking his exit. Also helps me not have to sacrifice this stone.]
;B[ci]
C[Five space jump from one stone is wayy too far.];W[cg]
C[I was totally fine invading since I had lots of white thickness nearby. I was also already thinking about capping this corner at some point, so he really helped me out with this move.]
(;B[ck]
C[Only one space jump? Gotta go further to make room for eyes. Furthermore it reduces white's potential more. This was a mistake.]
;W[cm]
C[First, punish the mistake.];B[bg]
(;W[cf]
C[I suppose a better move would have been B12.];B[bf];W[ce];B[be]
C[Here I'm letting him connect up his weak groups on purpose because he's making one point of territory per stone, while I'm building up a solid wall.]
;W[dd]
C[Continuing to build thickness and also connect my stones up by taking free moves. Of course he has to block.]
;B[dc];W[fc]
C[Intentionally threatening the cut, as well as aiming at connecting.];B[ea]
(;W[ed]
C[This move looks gote but it really takes an important liberty away from the E17 group. It also would have really hurt if black played here.]
(;B[qf]
C[Here, I think he could have gone further. I can't invade the way I did in the upper left corner because there's a lot more of his friends in the neighborhood. Plus you can put pressure on my two white stones.]
;W[cc]
C[I considered B17 briefly but I decided that I didn't want to give him the choice of which group to save. I couldn't win a capturing race against the lower three stones since I can't easily cut his C11 stone. But the E17 group is looking awfuly weak, and it's worth causing trouble in the corner. Since he's already sealed in, this fight won't spill out onto the rest of the board. So, worth trying, even if I lose.]
;B[bd];W[cb]
C[Boy am I ever not nice!]
(;B[db]
C[At this point, there's no saving the four stones stones. Better would be to leave them for aji, or to start the capturing race from the other side at B17 to help make his left group live as well.]
;W[fa]
C[This move was a misclick but oh well, it worked out in the end.];B[ga]
;W[ha];B[ca];W[ba];B[bb]
C[Good, force me to take.];W[da];B[bc]
C[Again, good.];W[eb];B[hb]
C[Initially I felt this move was a mistake but it has good followups by connecting out towards L17.]
;W[fa]
(;B[ib]
C[This move was a mistake since it's too easily cut. K18 instead leads to a much better result for black.]
;W[jb];B[ia];W[ga];B[ja];W[kb];B[lc]
(;W[lb]
C[This was a mistake on my part. This move is unnecessary and I should have read it out. Even without this move there's no saving the four black stones; and I possibly could have profitted further by letting black try to crawl.]
;B[ip]
C[Perfect! Gives himself a two space base on either side, but is as far away from the white thickness as possible.]
;W[gp]
C[Of course I blocked from this direction to push him towards my thickness, and secure my own corner more.]
;B[pr]
C[This hane ends in gote for black because the ladder works for white. So this was a bad exchange and he should have instead played M4 to make a base.]
;W[or]
(;B[qs];W[kp]
C[I'm not sure if this is the best move; J6 to push him more towards my wall would probably be better. But I figure better to rob him of a base since his hane didn't work.]
;B[kq];W[jq]
C["Play severe moves near your wall" :)];B[jp]
C[This is what I'd play too. It's a cross-cut with black already a stone ahead.]
;W[iq]
C[Extending the weaker stone. I decided to extend towards my own stone since downward is not exactly safety.]
(;B[ko]
C[Instead of this atari towards white's thickness, I would have attacked on the other side with the hane at H3.]
;W[lp];B[lq]
C[Now at this point, I saw through reading that my two white stones on the right were safe, even if I tenuki. Because the ladder works for white, and if he just makes me extend then I'm just running to my own thickness. So I decided to protect against the scary H3 hane instead of responding to M3.]
;W[hp];B[mp]
C[Surely he saw the ladder works for white.];W[lo];B[kn]
C[And sure enough he stopped immediately. But now he's got two weak groups near a lot of white strength, so he's going to be in trouble.]
;W[ln]
C[This is my weakest group on the board so strengthen it. It directly attacks the L5 group, but also indirectly attacks the M3 group since he's going to get sealed in.]
(;B[in]
C[It's good to play shape moves, sure, but in this case I think you have to keep extending, because…]
;W[km]
C[…this hane is pretty severe. Not only does it set up a double atari at K5, it also really cramps black in.]
;B[jm]
C[This feels very slow after J6. Definitely should have extended one more time.]
(;W[lm]
C[Here I fix solidly rather than M8 to avoid giving up free moves.];B[os]
C[Black tries to connect to save his three stones?];W[nr];B[mr];W[ns]
C[This move was a mistake. Instead I should have fixed with O4. Because if black ignores the (pointless) atari and instead cuts at P3, this ends very poorly for white.]
(;B[ps];W[np]
C[Here I played a shape move to make sure I didn't get cut. Nowhere else to play. I got lucky.]
;B[nq]
C[This is gote, not sure why he played it.];W[oq];B[mq];W[no]
C[Fix, since my group is awfully short on liberties. I also don't want black trying to get out by taking free moves.]
;B[hq]
(;W[hr]
C[I atari this way because G3 would be giving my two stones up, letting black connect. I also saw of course that the ladder works.]
;B[ir]
C[Good move!]
(;W[jr]
C[I spent a while considering my response. I didn't want to capture the ladder with G3, because that would let black live at the bottom (though from looking at the variation it looks like he doesn't have enough eyespace). So I was willing to play out the ladder a bit then capture the J2 stone to give myself the necessary liberty when H2 was atari'd.]
(;B[om]
C[But instead he tenuki'd. And this seems like an overplay.];W[pm]
C[Because the cut works effortlessly thanks the R8.]
(;B[qm]
C[This seems like it does nothing for black, but it strengthen white's local position by making the stones connect, which also kills the P7 stone. Better to make mischief with that cutting stone instead, like P8 or O7.]
;W[pl];B[io]
C[Fixing the double atari. Sure. This move is gote though. It would be a very long time before I spent the gote move myself to collect four strategically useless points.]
(;W[sm]
C[I thought about trying to capture the cutting stone since it leaves a lot of aji, but even going through the motions of capturing it would have possibly led to the P3 group being captured instead since it's so short on liberties. So I decided to take some free moves instead to see how safe the corner is, and to build my outside influence for the next fight.]
;B[sn]
C[Wait what!];W[rn]
C[He immediately resigned after this mistake.])
