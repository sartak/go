C[This is from Graded Go Problems I think :)];B[mc]
C[I think M17 would have been better? Though that does leave the potential for an invasion at O17.]
;W[gc]
C[Make a base.];B[fb];W[gb]
C[Shape move.];B[kc];W[kd]
C[Hane this direction of course.];B[ld];W[ke];B[le];W[kf]
C[I was hoping he'd play M14 so I could hane again, but he tenuki'd. Which means I could later play M14 and be very happy.]
;B[qn];W[ql]
C[I decided to pincer to either get a wall facing my D4 stone, or build up a solid amount of territory on the bottom.]
;B[qq];W[pq]
C[Blocked this way to develop the bottom.];B[qp];W[po]
C[After I played this I worried that the right move was Q6 instead but no! I played the one 100% of pro games have played. Phew.]
;B[pn];W[qo]
C[Again I played the pro move. Phew!];B[ro];W[on]
C[Oops. This is not joseki. Better to hane the other way or cut.

But I was thinking I will sacrifice my stone to get an even bigger wall.]
;B[rm]
C[This move surprised me though I guess he's protecting the cut. Seems too passive.]
;W[rl]
C[Which is why I punished by blocking his exit. Also helps me not have to sacrifice this stone.]
;B[ci]
C[Five space jump from one stone eh.];W[cg]
C[I was totally fine invading since I had lots of white thickness nearby. I was also thinking about capping his corner at some point, so he really helped me out with this move.]
;B[ck]
C[Only one space jump?];W[cm]
C[Well first I'm going to punish that!];B[bg];W[cf];B[bf];W[ce];B[be]
C[Here I'm intentionally milking his desire to connect up his weak group as much as I possibly can. He's making one point of territory per stone while I'm building up another solid wall.]
;W[dd]
C[Again trying to build thickness and also connect my stones up by taking free moves.]
;B[dc];W[fc]
C[Intentionally threatening the cut, as well as aiming at connecting.];B[ea]
(;W[ed]
C[This move looks gote but it really takes a liberty away from the E17 group. It also would have really hurt if black played here.]
;B[qf];W[cc]
C[I considered B17 briefly but I decided that I didn't want to give him the option of which group to save. I didn't think I could win a capturing race against the lower three stones since I can't easily cut his D11 stone. But the E17 group is looking awful weak, and it's worth causing trouble in the corner anyway since he's already sealed in, so this fight won't spill out onto the rest of the board.]
;B[bd];W[cb]
(;B[db]
C[At this point there's no saving his stones. Better would be to leave them for aji, or to start the capturing race from the other side to help make it live as well.]
;W[fa]
C[This move was a misclick but oh well, it worked out in the end.];B[ga]

;W[ga];B[ja];W[kb];B[lc]
(;W[lb]
C[This was unnecessary and I should have read it out. Oh well. Even without this move there's no saving his four stones; and I possibly could have profitted by letting black try to crawl.]
;B[ip];W[gp]
C[Blocked this way to push him towards my thickness, and secure my own corner more.]
;B[pr]
C[This hane ends in gote because the ladder works for white. So this was a bad exchange for black.]
;W[or]
(;B[qs];W[kp]
C[I'm not sure if this is the best move; J6 to push him more towards my wall would probably be better. But I figure better to rob him of a base since his hane didn't work.]
;B[kq];W[jq]
C[Severe moves near a wall :)];B[jp]
C[This is what I'd play too.];W[iq]
C[Extending the weaker stone. I decided to extend towards my own stone since downward is not exactly safety.]
(;B[ko]
C[Instead of this atari of me towards my own stones I would have attacked on the other side, maybe with the hane.]
;W[lp];B[lq]
C[Now at this point I saw through reading that my two white stones on the right were safe even if I tenuki. Because the ladder works for white, and if he just makes me extend then I have a lot of thickness nearby. So I decided to protect against that scary hane instead.]
;W[hp];B[mp]
C[Surely he saw the ladder works for me.];W[lo];B[kn];W[ln];B[in]
C[It's good to play shape moves, sure, but in this case I think you have to keep extending.]
;W[km]
C[Because the hane is pretty severe. Not only does it set up a double atari, but it really cramps black in.]
;B[jm]
C[Now black's shape move looks a little silly.];W[lm]
C[Fixing solidly to avoid giving up free moves.];B[os]
C[Black tries to connect to save his three stones?];W[nr];B[mr];W[ns]
C[This move was a mistake. Instead I should have fixed with O4. Because if black ignores the (pointless) atari and cuts, it ends very poorly for white.]
(;B[ps];W[np]
C[Here I played a shape move to make sure I didn't get cut. Playing elsewhere would have lead to some serious damage.]
;B[nq]
C[Gote.];W[oq];B[mq];W[no]
C[Fix, since my group is awful short on liberties.];B[hq];W[hr];B[ir]
(;W[jr]
C[I spent a while considering this move. I didn't want to capture the ladder just to let black live at the bottom (though from looking at the variation it looks like black doesn't have enough eyespace anyway). So I was willing to play out the ladder a bit then capture the J2 stone to give myself the necessary liberty when H2 was atari'd.]
(;B[om]
C[But instead he tenuki'd. And this seems like an overplay.];W[pm]
C[Of course I cut!]
(;B[qm]
C[This seems like it does nothing but strengthen my local position. Better to make mischief with the cutting stone.]
;W[pl];B[io]
C[Fixing the double atari. Sure. Gote though. It was going to be a long time before I spent the gote moves to collect four strategically useless points.]
(;W[sm]
C[I thought about trying to capture the cutting stone since it leaves a lot of aji, but even going through the motions of capturing it would have possibly led to P3 being captured instead since it's so short on liberties. So I decided to take some free moves instead.]
;B[sn]
C[Wait what!];W[rn]
C[He immediately resigned after this mistake.])
