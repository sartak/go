C[Played this corner because it's the wider side.];W[pp];B[co];W[cm];B[cq]
C[I didn't want him to start chasing me right away, so I wanted to first establish a foothold in the corner.]
;W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[dp]
C[Now time to get out.];W[eq];B[ep];W[fq]
(;B[ck]
C[I didn't want to keep pushing from behind. Now that I have a stronger black group I can counter-counterattack.]
;W[em];B[go]
C[But he has a strong white group too, and I don't want to get sealed in. Oops.]
;W[bo]
C[Trying to steal my eyes and make some for himself.];B[cn];W[bn];B[hq];W[gp]
C[This is an overplay.];B[hp];W[ho];B[gn];W[fo];B[fp];W[gq];B[fn]
C[Yum.];W[bp]
C[I'm not sure why he peeped here. I felt at the time that he was trying to induce heaviness but it's just making me stronger.]
;B[cp];W[dn];B[en];W[fm];B[io]
C[I atari'd this way because I didn't want to sacrifice my two stones (as well as probably the entire bottom side).]
;W[hn];B[gm]
C[Also don't want to get sealed in because then I'm totally dead.];W[im]
;B[hm]
C[I atari'd to get another liberty and to help my group spread out into the center.]
;W[in];B[jo]
C[But I knew I was weakening my black stones again. Worth it.];W[jq]
C[This dude loves fighting. (You'll see lots more!)];B[jp]
C[I liked knocking him on the head rather than just connecting. To start a fight.]
;W[kq];B[il]
C[Time to chase a weak group and earn some profit!];W[jm];B[jl];W[km]
(;B[hk]
C[At first I worried that this move might be too slow but it turns out if white gets to play here first, it really hurts. I'm desperately worried about getting cut!]
;W[gl];B[hl];W[gk];B[gj];W[pm]
C[Nice defensive move; I can now only do so much damage by running him all the way to the edge of the board.

I like this move a lot. I think when he played this I decided that white was a stronger player than I am, because I wouldn't think of this.]
;B[lo];W[mm]
C[This is a good move that saves his group and puts a LOT of pressure on my weak group (more than I realized)]
(;B[ek]
C[I mirrored what he did earlier at K3. But it was unnecessary, I should have been more violent. Playing the atari would have ended profitably for me.]
;W[fl];B[aq]
C[I have enough stones above him now that I want to try to seal him in. First step is preventing the connection to his living group on the side. CUT!]
;W[bk]
C[He sees what I'm doing of course.];B[cj];W[bj];B[bi];W[ci]
C[Oh man this guy loves a cut.];B[ch]
C[In retrospect I should have atari'd the other way, because it builds up my own group. Atari'ing this way forces white to attack me, more or less. Oops!]
;W[di];B[bl]
C[I played here rather than connecting to invite him to take the bait. I don't care about that stone. He should have blocked. He probably would have made enough room for two eyes.]
(;W[bh];B[cl];W[fj]
C[Too little too late. Maybe he's inducing me to capture so that he can build influence, or maybe he is just trying desperately to save his groups.]
;B[fk];W[ej];B[el]
C[Not enough liberties to goof off, man. You're toast.];W[dm];B[bm];W[hj]
;B[gi];W[ai]
C[I think this was a wasted move. Maybe he was feeling a little annoyed that he lost so many stones, or that he was just being extra cautious because of it.]
;B[dh]
C[This was the weakest stone, and I wanted to start forming up some territory up in the corner, as well as establishing a strong group to help surround the suddenly weak white group.]
;W[cg]
C[He's attacking to make eyespace. Good call.];B[dg];W[cf];B[df]
C[He's probably alive now. But I'm happy with what I've got too.];W[iq]
C[Here goes. I knew already that it was going to be impossible for me to escape, so my goal was to try to get to a side and build two eyes.

I was fine sacrificing the two stones if needed. (I know I said earlier I wasn't, but now I'm desperate)]
;B[no];W[mq];B[nq];W[pq]
(;B[on]
C[I couldn't really attack the stone I attached to because those three white stones have a lot of liberties and I'm unlikely to capture it.

So I played here. White can't protect both ways, so I was hoping this would let me break past him.
]
;W[om];B[pn];W[qm];B[qn];W[rm]
C[He's playing very solidly both to block me and also to build a wall. Nice.

I paid dearly by trying to save this group. In the future, sacrifice but profit from it. I could have attacked from the top and threatened to connect.]
;B[rp];W[rq];B[qp];W[qq];B[po];W[rn]
C[Eyepoke. Argh.];B[nr];W[mr];B[lm];W[ll];B[ln];W[kl];B[nl];W[nm];B[ml]
C[This is more what I'm talking about! I pulled off a pretty sharp cut.]
;W[kj];B[lk];W[kk];B[lj];W[qe]
C[Clearly a ladderbreaker.]
(;B[li]
C[I ended up playing here because I knew keeping pressure on this big white group would be the most profitable plan.]
;W[ki];B[kh]
C[I continue attacking this group because first of all, hey, maybe it'll work (not likely just because of the marked stones). It's starting to erase white's potential on the right.]
TR[hp:hq];W[jh];B[ji]
C[I knew the cut works painlessly because of all the local black strength.]
;W[lh];B[kg]
C[I don't care about his cut right now; if he wants to attack this cutting stone so be it.]
;W[mh];B[nj]
C[I do care about this group though, so I played the shape move even though it's slow.]
;W[ip]
C[He's scared. :)];B[hr];W[gr]
(;B[kn]
C[I should have played above, since my group down here is still unsettled (at best). I did make space for eye though. I looked around to see if I could trick white into letting me make another, but couldn't see anything promising.]
TR[ko];W[ir];B[jg];W[pj]
C[Time to dance.];B[nh]
C[Putting pressure on his weak stones to escape.];W[og]
C[I think he's trying to cut me from the one black stone in the corner but I'm happy to go left too.]
;B[ng]
C[Looks like I successfully escape past him.];W[qd];B[pe];W[qf]
C[He's trying to claim the entire side for himself.];B[pg];W[pf]
C[I wish I were more clever about setting up low-value cuts because this guy takes 'em all.]
;B[of];W[oe]
(;B[od]
C[This was probably not the right way to atari. But none of the options look particularly great.]
;W[nf];B[mg]
C[Definitely don't want to get cut!];W[nd]
C[I'm okay sacrificing those three stones.];B[oh];W[ne]
C[It's not clear to me why he filled his own tiger's mouth. Maybe he's worried about the ko?]
;B[ld]
C[I have a lot of local strength now, so I'm staking out the entire upper middle for myself, and stopping him from progressing further.]
(;W[oc]
C[This surprised me. Again I don't think this is necessary. Maybe he's just feeling a little overly defensive. If he attacked as in the variation it would have gone much better for him!]
;B[qh]
C[Reducing! I didn't want to play too close to that wall though.];W[pc]
C[Why?? I don't see anything remotely resembling vulnerability worth making the capture!]
;B[jj]
C[Since he wasted a move, I took that opportunity to clear some aji. Maybe I could have pressed deeper.]
;W[oj];B[ol]
C[I wanted to threaten the cut.];W[pl];B[qk]
C[This was probably an overplay; at least, it was the way I handled the followup.]
;W[qi]
(;B[pi];W[qj];B[pk];W[ok];B[rk];W[mi]
C[Damn, I didn't realize how precarious the situation was!]
(;B[mj]
C[There's no way to save all my stones.];W[nk];B[ni];W[mk];B[rh]
C[I didn't expect to be able to save the three stones but it was worth a shot, especially since it continues the reduction (in sente, turns out).]
;W[rj];B[sj];W[si];B[ri];W[sk];B[sh];W[sj]
(;B[hi]
C[Clearing more aji. It wasn't worth the anxiety.];W[ce]
C[I paid for it though, this was a big move. I would've gotten nice shape if I had played it, and white would have had to struggle to live.]
;B[de];W[ec]
C[Very much an overplay. I have a five-tall wall, and he has nowhere to run.]
;B[dc]
C[So I play calmly defensive.];W[fd];B[hd]
C[Force him against that wall.];W[hb];B[jb];W[ic];B[jc];W[id];B[he]
C[This is fun!];W[jd];B[kd];W[ib]
C[Maybe he's trying to secure eyespace, but this slow move probably would have been better if he continued aiming for his upper right corner.]
;B[ke];W[lb]
C[No you may not cut.];B[kc]
C[I didn't play a fancy hit, just wanted to instill fear by playing solidly.]
;W[gd];B[eb]
C[Reducing eyespace and preventing him from trying to escape into the corner.]
;W[fb];B[ed]
C[Induce heaviness!];W[fc];B[db]
C[Fixing the defect because I'd be real sad if a simple mistake cost me the kill.]
;W[hc]
C[There's one eye but it's going to be very tough to make a second.];B[ia]
;W[ha];B[ja];W[ge];B[hf];W[gf];B[hg];W[gg]
C[I'm fine letting him run out because I know he won't be able to make a second eye against my wall.]
;B[gh];W[fg];B[fh]
C[But I also want to make sure he doesn't connect, because that would be one hell of a reduction.]
;W[eh];B[eg];W[ei];B[cd]
C[Now that his status as dead is sealed, I decide to start working on the last unsettled area of the board.]
;W[bc]
C[Overplay much?];B[bd];W[cb]
C[Oh he is trying to make this a capturing race! I guess I didn't connect, huh. Now at this point I get a little concerned that he may actually win the race, and I lost my chance to make two eyes.]
;B[be]
C[No matter. Just play solidly and take advantage of free moves.];W[bf];B[af]
C[Atari.];W[bg];B[ak];W[aj];B[ag]
C[I didn't connect to save the stone I just threw in because I am just trying to reduce his liberties, and the lower black group is definitely safe.]
;W[ae];B[ad]
C[I think he copied me but there was no point? Since it didn't reduce me a liberty.]
;W[al];B[am];W[ea]
C[Here we go. This move reduces one of my liberties in sente.];B[da];W[fa]
;B[gb]
C[I played this move IMMEDIATELY. It's the best we can do online since we can't physically slap stones onto the board.]
;W[ca];B[fi]
C[I knew I was going to win the capturing race since I only have to capture one of his groups to survive.]
;W[ef]
C[Here was a clever move to try to make a second eye. It also reduces me by two liberties.]
(;B[ee]
C[Poke that eye.];W[fe];B[dj];W[bi];B[ak];W[cc]
C[I'm surprised he didn't play a ko threat. I still have one more liberty but he could have profited from it, or made the game more complicated, at least.]
;B[ah];W[ab]
C[I've done way too many tsumego to let you get away with living!];B[ba]
;W[mc]
C[Now shoring up that last border.];B[md];W[ar]
C[I suspect he thought he might trick me into losing my group…];B[eo]
C[…but I don't want to risk it one bit. Even though this move is not necessary, I know I'm ahead so I'm okay playing inefficient but safe moves.]
;W[rf];B[me];W[lc];B[jk];W[]
C[He passed so I was okay passing too. I didn't want to be a sore winner by taking one or two point moves when he just wanted to end it.]
