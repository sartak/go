C[This struck me as uselessly high; if you want influence play hoshi, if you want territory play the third line. Fifth line just yells "I emphatically do not want territory" to me.]
;W[jd];B[jj]
C[Tengen was a surprise, but I suppose if we basically played the other 8 star points, it's a thing.]
;W[dm]
C[I wanted to approach while also building a base for my lonely stone.];B[qq]
C[Well okay then! This strikes me as a bad idea because in exchange for getting a few corner points, black gives white a lot of influence which will hurt those three black stones around it. Better to do this much later when any potential that the influence would provide has already been settled.]
;W[pq]
C[I played this direction because the fifth-line black stone seemed a lot less threatening.]
;B[qp];W[qo]
(;B[pr]
C[The only move is A to build up enough eyespace. The joseki dictionary says  like, 100% of the time A is played.]
LB[ro:A];W[or]
C[I should have punished with A I think, since he played his previous move out of order.]
LB[ro:A];B[qs]
C[I guess black is worried about a cut… but really black should be worried about living.]
;W[ro]
C[Now black definitely does not have enough space to live.];B[rp];W[rr]
C[Trying to pop out any possible eyes.];B[rs]
C[I'm not sure if this move accomplishes anything. In any case white correctly ignores it and tenukis.]
;W[qj]
C[I decided to play here to start to make use of the new influence I have in the corner.]
;B[qr]
C[Really? :O

Black has now given me two free moves in fuseki so he could lock down about four points. That's basically giving me two handicap stones. Which I used to claim the right side.]
;W[pi]
C[I played this direction to push black downward to my wall. If he plays the other direction I get the entire side quite peacefully I think.]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[ql];W[pl]
C[I crosscut because of my strength in the corner. And I'm already one stone ahead, locally, which makes all the difference.]
;B[pm];W[ol];B[oj]
C[White's crosscut has been fruitful as black feels vulnerable.];W[oi]
C[I continue the attack to build up more influence at little cost (since black is just running without making territory or strength).]
;B[nj];W[om]
C[Continuing the offensive so that I don't become the weak group myself now that black could potentially surround me.]
;B[pn]
(;W[on]
C[I was happy with running black all the way into my wall. But it turns out with this move I definitely sacrifice the two white stones there.]
;B[po];W[oo]TR[ol:oo][pp:pq][or]
C[Whatever the outcome I'm quite happy with this wall.];B[rn]
C[This was a good move that I didn't expect. It turns out these white stones have been doomed for a while.]
;W[rl]
C[If I'm going to lose those two stones I'll at least get something out of it: capturing the cutting stone to connect my groups.]
(;B[qn];W[qm];B[rm];W[ql]
C[Now I ended up with a gigantically strong white group, and black has a 13 point corner. I'm still fine with that.]
;B[op];W[oq];B[np];W[nq];B[mq]
C[This was an overplay since white quite profitably cuts this soon. Better would have been to extend one more time and really attack my lower white group, since I'll have trouble making two eyes.]
;W[mr];B[lq];W[mp]
C[Here I read out that the net works. But I'll take as much profit (another layer of wall for my strong group!) as black allows.]
;B[no];W[mo];B[nn];W[mn];B[nm];W[ml];B[os];W[nr];B[lr]
C[Two liberties vs two liberties, but it's white's turn, so white wins the capturing race.]
(;W[nl]
C[I'm not sure if the other point would have been better. I suspect it would have been because the other group is the weaker one.]
;B[mi];W[ni]
C[I wanted to strengthen my group and threaten a cut.];B[lj]
C[I was surprised this wasn't a direct connection but I guess with the black stone a one point jump away it works fine.]
;W[jl]
C[This suggests a cut and also expands my influence.];B[kl]
C[This seemed like an overplay so I attacked.];W[kk]
C[Push you into my wall! It also peeps at the same time.];B[km];W[kj]
C[Poke :)];B[ki];W[lk]
C[I played here to maintain my connection and also to continue my attack.]
;B[mk];W[lh]
C[White peeps to overconcentrate black in exchange for more outside stones. Though there's no good followup so maybe this was an overplay, or at least there are better moves to make. Arguably a mistake that lets black fix shape, too. White is a little too greedy for outside influence.]
;B[li];W[jk]
C[I'm a little concerned with getting hemmed in so I start pushing.];B[ij]
;W[jm];B[kn];W[jn];B[jp];W[io];B[ip];W[ho];B[hp];W[gp]
C[This was an overplay, I should have pushed one more time. But I think I was too greedy.]
;B[ej]
C[I read this as a tenuki rather than a ladderbreaker. Oops.];W[ei];B[in]
(;W[im]
C[If I atari'd the other direction it would have worked but I misread. I didn't realize white had one extra liberty at the triangle. Crud!]
TR[ll];B[hn];W[hm];B[go];W[gm]
C[I'm overly cautious of losing big groups due to being overeager. So lately I've been making extra sure I avoid leaving weak groups on the board.]
;B[gn];W[fj]
C[Now, about that ladderbreaker you'd let me reduce to two liberties…]
;B[ek];W[dk]
C[I blocked from this side both to start claiming the side and also to push black into my strength.]
;B[el];W[em]
C[No you will not connect down there!];B[fk];W[gj];B[gk];W[hj]
C[I was so excited about this because I knew I'd enclosed the group and now I have even more outside strength.]
;B[hk];W[ji]
C[I played here instead of the obvious cut to entice black to connect and make my capture all the bigger. Obviously if he connects I extend this stone to block.]
;B[fm];W[fn];B[fl];W[fo]
C[This was greedy; I was trying to block black and also recover my one stone. I almost lost it all because of the black stone on the star point which causes trouble for white 60 moves from now.]
;B[ii]
C[Now at this point I become very concerned that black will cut at A and then win the capturing race. I spent a lot of my clock time counting liberties and reading out possibilities. In the end I decided I was okay, but I still had a LOT of anxiety about it. I didn't want to waste a move connecting if I didn't have to. I concluded that A and B were miai and if I got one of them I'd be okay.]
LB[ll:A][ik:B];W[jh];B[mh]
C[During the game I was surprised black played here but now I see how important it was that he didn't get blocked in, as he'd lose any capturing race.]
;W[lg];B[kh];W[jg];B[ng];W[mg];B[nh];W[nf];B[og];W[of];B[pg];W[pf]
C[Since I had the big white group, I knew I was safe to push from behind since there's no way black could make eyes. I'm also happy to build another wall.]
;B[qg]
(;W[rf]
C[Instead of this, I should have fixed my defect; black still would not have had enough room to make two eyes (he doesn't even have one yet), plus I get a tiger's mouth.]
;B[qi]
C[Good move.];W[qh]
C[This was a stupid error on my part.];B[ri];W[rh];B[rg];W[sg];B[ph];W[sh]
;B[si];W[sf];B[qf];W[re];B[qe];W[rd]
C[I keep pushing because I know if I cap too soon I'll have a shortage of liberties.]
;B[qd];W[qc]
C[At this point I'm happy because black can still only make one eye.

I'm okay capping here because I read that a cut at A would die.]
LB[rc:A];B[pe];W[od]
C[Again, rather than capping, build strength by extending which has a better result. This is one of the bad reflexes I'm consciously trying to break.]
;B[mf];W[lf];B[me];W[md]
C[This was a mistake. I should have played the one next to it.];B[oe]
C[At this point I felt very foolish.];W[le];B[ne];W[rj]
C[At this point I'm annoyed and want to clear some aji.];B[oh];W[sj];B[pi]
;W[ko]
C[This was a stupid mistake I didn't read at all. I'm clearly frustrated by the two mistakes in the top right.]
;B[lo];W[ln];B[kp];W[ll]
C[Finally get to play that anxiety reducing move.];B[ik]
C[And sure enough black noticed it was miai as well.];W[hh];B[hi]
(;W[gh]
C[Again, trying not to cap directly. Which was good because if I had, that'd have been double atari. There's no more capturing race because I'd connected so I am more worried about keeping black hemmed in.]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[en]
C[This concerned me a great deal. I ended up playing at the net point to try to convince black to take the sacrifice of a meaningless stone instead of taking a stone that reduces the large black group's liberties.]
;W[do];B[dn];W[cm]
(;B[cn]
C[This was a wasted move; black should have continued the offensive he would have won the capturing race.]
;W[co];B[eo];W[fp];B[bo];W[cp];B[cq];W[ep]
C[Black's lack of focus gives me extra liberties by letting me sacrifice meaningless stones.]
;B[bp];W[fr]
C[This is still not enough for white.]
(;B[bm];W[ck];B[fi]
C[White only wins this capture race because of self-liberty-shorting moves like this one.]
;W[gi];B[fh];W[eh];B[fg];W[ih];B[di]
C[Black really missed that the bottom group is the one that's in danger. Now I win the capturing race.]
;W[dh];B[ci];W[gl];B[bk];W[hl]
C[I shouldn't have let black get away with free moves but I was willing to sacrifice a couple moves for the game-winning capture.]
;B[eq]
C[Too little too late :/];W[fq];B[er];W[ch];B[bh];W[bg];B[bi];W[cf];B[gg]
;W[ge]
C[Really just enjoying the incredible strength I have on the board now.]
;B[eg];W[df]
C[At this point I win just by playing defensively, really.];B[hg];W[jf];B[fs]
;W[gs];B[hs]
C[I was surprised he atari'd instead of connected. Maybe he wanted a ko fight? But this ko doesn't mean anything.]
;W[es];B[gr];W[hr];B[fs];W[il];B[gq];W[fm];B[cj]
C[Not sure what this accomplishes. If he wants to connect he's got to do it at A.]
LB[bl:A];W[bl]
C[… which I forbid. Though he can still connect underneath, I didn't want to make it too easy.]
(;B[ir];W[gs];B[hq];W[am]
C[Now he's cut.];B[aj]
C[Too late to make life.];W[ah];B[bn];W[cc]
C[Ensuring he doesn't get the corner.];B[nd];W[nc];B[pc]
C[Nice try, for real, but it's a little too ambitious.];W[oc];B[pb];W[qb]
;B[ob];W[nb]
C[I was happily counting liberties this whole exchange.];B[qa];W[oa];B[rc]
;W[rb];B[sc];W[sb]
C[I guess he was hoping I'd block on the other side and reduce myself to atari.]
