C[I played this corner specifically because I've been told it's better to play farther away than the two stones already on the board.]
;W[dd]WL[58.0];B[cf]BL[34.0];W[df]WL[49.0]
C[Well, then. Right into fighting!]
(;B[ce]BL[3.0]LB[cg:A][dg:B]
C[This seemed like the most natural response but I don't know if A or B might have been better, given white at 4-4. Maybe A looks a little better for me.]

C[â€¦ and since it wasn't, I think I'll  take it.]
(;W[be]WL[32.0]LB[ee:A]
C[Again I was kind of expecting A. All these moves are indeed flustering me.

At this point in the game I didn't have a sense yet whether this player is worse, or much better, than me. IGS ranked them at "15k+", so probably better.]

;W[fj]WL[250.0];B[em]BL[26.0];W[hm]WL[245.0]
C[Yep, he's definitely trying to escape. I don't think I could have skipped 49 to go straight to 50 though.]
;B[gm]BL[19.0]
C[With 50 the white group escaped so 51 was probably a bad move. I should have made moves to take the corner instead of trying to capture.]

C[This move didn't seem to accomplish much; it certainly didn't put any pressure on my 5 black stones, and it's not like I could have invaded from the bottom anyway. So I rightly ignored it.]
