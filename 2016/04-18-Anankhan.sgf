C[This struck me as a little strange.];W[pg]
C[Make a base.];B[pl];W[nc]
C[Surround black's corner.];B[ne];W[jd];B[ld]
C[I suppose I invited this move by playing so far away.];W[lc]
C[Fight!

I suppose this wasn't the best move because it gives black an opportunity to make a wall which would completely crush my two stones on the right side.]
;B[kc];W[kd]
C[The cross-cut seemed ideal for me since I have two supporting stones right here.]
;B[mc]
C[Black is creating so many defects for himself!];W[lb];B[jc];W[md]
(;B[nb]
C[Black should have just given this stone up to save the other one, I think. I'm not sure what benefit he thought he was getting.]
;W[oc];B[ob];W[pc];B[pb];W[qc];B[qb]
C[I was fine pushing this far because I knew black would have trouble making life, and it gives me a lot of strength!]
;W[rb]
C[I hane'd to avoid letting him making a living shape. I was also clear of his 4-4 stone which may have made an earlier hane more dangerous.]
;B[rd]
C[Not sure why he reverse peeped me.];W[qd];B[qe];W[pe]
C[I like attacking :-)];B[od]
(;W[nd]
C[This was the obvious direction to atari from.];B[oe];W[pf];B[le];W[me]
;B[mf]
C[This is just barely not an overplay, since it puts me in atari.]
(;W[rc]
C[I had to play here rather than capture because the other direction invites a harsh cut that saves the four stones at the top and completely wrecks my corner.]
(;B[re]
C[Black should have given these up to save the more important stones.];W[nf]
;B[mb]
C[I was a little annoyed that he now captures my two white stones but I think the tradeoff is worth it; a few points for sealing in more-strategically-important stones.]
;W[lf];B[ke];W[kf];B[je];W[id]
(;B[kb]
C[Black was worried about the hane but could have pushed instead. Plus, my three stones do not have enough liberties to hane. So this was more or less a wasted move.]
(;W[jf]
C[I should have hane'd instead, it works out better because it gives my weak group liberties for free.]
;B[ie];W[hd];B[he];W[gd];B[ge];W[fd]
C[Again I was fine pushing because I was making fourth-line territory. Or so I thought.]
;B[gb]
C[Dude monkey jumped me!

(More or less)

It looks like the best response is A.]
LB[gc:A]
(;W[hb];B[ib]
(;W[ic]
C[I think the best response is instead A, because then no matter what he does I can cut off the deep stone. Now I know for future reference to consider the first-line response!]
LB[ha:A];B[ha];W[hc];B[eb]
C[I really spent a while analyzing my response to this. I thought there might be a throw-in tesuji but couldn't find anything. At best I could donate points to black…]
;W[cb]
C[…so I played a defensive move. None of the closer moves seemed to contain him effectively.]
;B[dc];W[cc]
C[Tried to block him from going any further.];B[de]
C[Damn. This dude has some strangely good moves for someone rated 20k.]
(;W[ee]
C[I was extremely concerned about my large white group dying - it would have cost me the game - so I played this odd move. It cost me the corner but it saved me the game.]
;B[cd]
(;W[df]
C[I didn't want to simply connect because it felt like I would cut myself off from the rest of the board and then die for lack of eyespace.]
;B[ed];W[fe]
C[Yay I escaped.];B[ef];W[ff];B[eg];W[dg]
(;B[eh]
C[Turning would have been better I think, since that huge group is much more urgent.]
;W[ce]
C[I couldn't connect, but I could threaten to connect to try to build eyespace.]
;B[dd];W[be];B[bd];W[dh]
(;B[ei]
C[I was surprised his response was here and not A. If I were to try to cut, it's a ladder that works for black.]
LB[di:A]
(;W[cj]
C[As soon as I played this move I got very worried that I'd just killed my group. And against a stronger player I would have; I don't see a way to save it.]
(;B[cf]
C[OMG! Huge mistake! Black should have punished my overplay.];W[bf];B[cg]
;W[ch];B[bg];W[bh];B[ag];W[ah];B[ae]
C[This move is so gote.];W[af];B[ad];W[dk]
C[Hane to start claiming my side and also to put the screws on the five stones that griefed me.]
;B[mg]
C[Dat aji…… is not as urgent as the left side right now.];W[fk]
C[I like this move because it puts pressure on the five black stones while also building out my moyo. I'm also always happy when I successfully ignore slack moves.]
(;B[ek]
C[Not sure if this move accomplishes anything. He wasn't able to make use of my shortened liberties.]
;W[el];B[ck];W[dl];B[cl];W[dm]
C[I wanted to play it safe and build up some more thickness after those last two kerfluffles.]
(;B[cn]
C[Seems a little premature to jump. This defect later contributed to his death. But I wasn't ready to turn into his defect yet; I wanted to make use of my corner stone.]
;W[dn]
(;B[do]
C[Again, not sure what the point of it is; it reduces his liberties by one.]
;W[eo];B[co];W[cp];B[bo];W[bp];B[bj];W[ci];B[ai]
C[I guess he's trying to make an eye here but it really doesn't accomplish much.]

C[Black dies.]
