-- chat --
sartak: yeah N14 is where I struggled for a bit. wasn't sure which way to atari
mcmillen: right, but nothing of mine down there and i didn't even have a plausible ladder-breaker as a threat
sartak: I figured better to sacrifice the weaker group

sartak: L16 though?
sartak: since my goal is the capture
sartak: I should have gone with my original plan to sacrifice those stones

-- chat --
sartak: K14 was my overplay
sartak: J14 might've worked better
mcmillen: yeah, i heard a proverb/rule of thumb about jump 1 from a group of 3, but 2 is dangerous, you have to read it out

]

;B[kf]C[

-- chat --
sartak: /me averts his eyes
mcmillen: so yeah, maybe sacrifice the two stones and at least keep the wall
sartak: nod
sartak: not like I'd be able to kill P17 anyway
mcmillen: right, me connecting the p17 group left it as the strongest thing in the area
mcmillen: yeah i don't know if this really counts as a tesuji but i have used it on people before :) 
mcmillen: usually on the edges when people have a loose set of stones surrounding me

sartak: losing sente with the exchange at the top right hurt
sartak: E8 was a good move
sartak: I'm going to learn that one :)
sartak: oh is that a shape I should know?
mcmillen: this is a good shape
sartak: oh yeah, the three makes sense
sartak: yeah, shouldn't have tenuki'd after the shoulder hit
mcmillen: the square stones are also a shape, though it's already a bit spoiled by d7
sartak: /me nods
mcmillen: but adding the two together makes it pretty strong

mcmillen: there's another shape move :)
sartak: I thought you were goading me into taking the D9 cut and then capturing or at least attacking those stones
sartak: heh
sartak: I should study shapes!
mcmillen: there is a really good lecture on youtube
mcmillen: search for "dsaun shape" i think
sartak: oh yeah that's on my list to watch. ok, maybe tonight!

-- chat --
sartak: part of my thinking here was to make sure my top left didn't get sealed off
sartak: but... I have no territory
sartak: well, one corner's worth
mcmillen: at this point i am mostly thinking, i have more points on the sides/corners, all i need to do is invade the middle from any direction, play solidly, and live
sartak: so at this point I have no chance
sartak: exactly

]

;B[dk]C[

-- chat --
sartak: and with the L13 group, my ability to seal off the center is already severely compromised
mcmillen: here i finally decide to fix the cut because the group was looking a little sad
sartak: that's why I played a little bit longer then resigned

-- chat --
sartak: since even though basically it faces away from your two groups, it connects to one of them
sartak: if I played above, J7 captures
mcmillen: yeah mostly while the pushing was going on, i was thinking "i need to bend down so that i can capture the cutting stone"
mcmillen: right
mcmillen: and i almost hane'd after 2, but thought it didn't feel solid

mcmillen: maybe just extend here

mcmillen: this way you're at elast marking territory along the bottom if i push
mcmillen: maybe, but you can strengthen it
sartak: anyway. thank you for the review, and thank you for the game!
mcmillen: thanks!
mcmillen: was a good game 
mcmillen: watch the shape lecture :) 
sartak: definitely :)
sartak: have a good night!
mcmillen: and always consider extend before atari when cut or cutting :)
mcmillen: you too!
sartak: I do
mcmillen: thanks for the game!

sartak: I suppose :)
