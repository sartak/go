C[I was happy I didn't reflexively extend. Let white take the corner with a crappy shape while I get the rest of the board.

I didn't read it out, but avoiding capture would have really hurt.]

C[At this point of the game I'm VERY happy. White has about seven points of territory, I have about fifteen and a GIANT WALL.]

C[Here's where it starts to go wrong.];B[cf];W[ie]
C[White takes a liberty to set up a forcing move, but also threatens to connect so I have to respond.]

C[I wasn't sure how to respond to that. I decided to play it safe, and I seem to recall that playing on the fourth bamboo-joint is good.]
