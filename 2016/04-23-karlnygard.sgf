;B[eq];W[cf]
C[Trying to prevent him from getting the entire left side.];B[nq];W[qn];B[qq]
C[This is way too early for a 3-3 invasion, and also I don't think it really works because of my stone at R6.]
;W[pq];B[or]
C[Now I'm thinking he sacrificed this one stone to get basically the entire bottom, since he is not trying to connect it.]
;W[pr]
C[But I am happy to take that sacrifice and start building a strong group right away]
;B[oo]
C[This didn't seem to demand an urgent response. And in evaluating the variations, looks like I was right.]
;W[fc]
C[I've heard that if you occupy both knight's moves from a 4-4 you're in good shape.]
(;B[cd]
C[Seems like a strange response to me.];W[ci]
C[I'm happy to stake out a bunch of territory for it.];B[cl];W[ic];B[nc]
;W[qf];B[pc];W[qc]
C[Blocking the corner.];B[kc];W[ld]
C[I shoulder hit since he was so close to my stone at J17. I figured good to build some influence on the outside if he's going to live on the inside.]
;B[lc];W[md];B[mc]

C[I value thickness even more nowadays so I probably would not have taken the atari, instead extending from Q16.]
;B[od];W[pb];B[nd];W[mf]
C[I'm happy with this result. He gets some territory on the top, I get much more on the right, and his wall is neutralized by so many of my stones in the neighborhood.]
;B[pj]
(;W[kd]
C[I should have punished his invasion instead.];B[qh];W[ph]
C[I've since better learned how to deal with invasions. Attaching makes him stronger, which is the opposite of what I want.]

C[Probing for a cut.];B[qk];W[pl];B[hp]
(;W[rl]
C[I'm fine giving him the bottom side if it costs him the right side. This lost sente though so I think playing S10 would have worked better.]
;B[rk];W[rm];B[ec];W[fd];B[rg];W[rf];B[qg];W[pg];B[sg]
C[I wouldn't play this move. The hane would have been gote for white, so it's not really urgent either.]
;W[sf];B[po];W[qo];B[op];W[qp]
C[Definitely don't want to be cut!];B[oj];W[nl]
C[Nor do I want to be sealed in.];B[mj];W[nj]
C[I played this because I have white stones surrounding him. I suppose I wanted to seal him in but no such luck, since my stones on both sides are too thin.]
;B[nk];W[ni];B[ok]

C[I would not play this nowadays. It gives black the entire bottom left quadrant!]
;B[mp];W[lo];B[ko];W[lp];B[lq];W[lk]
C[I didn't want him to connect everything (which turns out to probably have won me the game.]

C[The cut doesn't work here since he has nowhere to run.];W[mh];B[ng];W[nf]

C[This was overly cautious.];B[ki];W[ij];B[jj]
C[His wedge doesn't work either.];W[jk];B[ji];W[ik];B[hl];W[ii];B[jm]
C[This seemed like a wasted move. It's the shape point, but he also has the L6 escape route.]
;W[jg];B[ib];W[hb];B[jb];W[id];B[jc]
C[This is another wasted move that lets me get stronger for no benefit.]
;W[jd];B[ee];W[ef];B[fe];W[de];B[ed];W[ff];B[ge];W[gf];B[he];W[if]
C[I was happy to push out the wall here because it will let me attack the big dragon better. Furthermore, my stones are safe and he's not even making territory.]
;B[hf];W[hg];B[gh]
C[I'm not sure what the point of this move was since he's playing right in the middle of my thickness.]
;W[gi];B[fi];W[fh]
C[My crosscut is probably too slow. I should punish more for his ill-considered invasion.]
;B[gj];W[hi];B[fj];W[eh];B[ei];W[di];B[dk];W[ri]
C[I noticed that his dragon has been sealed in, without eyes, so time to kill.]
;B[qi]
(;W[rj]
C[I think black is already dead, no reason to play this. But, I'm okay wasting a move to ensure the BILLION points the kill earns.]
;B[be];W[bf];B[ae];W[af]
C[I guess we're in endgame now.]
(;B[bj];W[bi];B[aj]
