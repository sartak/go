;B[pd]C[sartak: are you here too?
Magnetic Spark: yeah
sartak: do you see move 1?
Magnetic Spark: I do
sartak: awesome! I guess I found the right button haha]

;W[dp]
;B[pq]C[Magnetic Spark: R4 is wrong I think
sartak: you want to make the biggest side yours
sartak: indeed
sartak: blue is longer than red
sartak: which is good for you because you made the long side yours
sartak: it's that simple :)
sartak: make sense?
Magnetic Spark: yeah]

;W[dd]C[sartak: I'm bad I basically always play the star points
Magnetic Spark: but what comes next is the "hard" part for me]

;B[qo]C[Magnetic Spark: so I took a bit of time on black 3 because I was trying to figure out the right direction to play :P
Magnetic Spark: I didn't knwo which stone to approach after the enclosure
sartak: this move is perfect
sartak: nod. luckily in this case I picked the first approach]

;W[qf]LB[nc:A]C[sartak: I picked this one because I didn't want you to have the entire right-hand side of the board
Magnetic Spark: wasn't  A good for making a big moyo?
sartak: that's above my skill level I think haha
sartak: but A is the other move I was considering
Magnetic Spark: I'll take a screenshot of this for later then
sartak: I haven't studied 3-4 joseki at all so I have no idea how to approach the bottom right corner
Magnetic Spark: this is the only joseki I know
sartak: but I do know it's a solid enclosure, that corner is all yours and I can't do anything about it]

;B[nc]C[Magnetic Spark: why is that a mistake? I thought I was aiming for the side
sartak: O17 is the right move]

;W[rd]C[sartak:  this is the joseki response by white, trying to take the corner]

;B[qc]C[sartak: this is the joseki response by black, blocking the corner]

;W[qi]C[Magnetic Spark: and now white jumps out to make a base
sartak: this is the joseki response by white, jumping down to make a base
sartak: exactly
sartak: black's response was tenuki]

(;B[fc]C[sartak: here's where you made a mistake
Magnetic Spark: I think maybe I sohuld've played N17 instead of O17
sartak: oh, I suppose, yeah
sartak: black doesn't have a base
sartak: which is why I pincered your F17 stone
sartak: for several reasons
Magnetic Spark: I was hopng the joseki would play out and I'd get the corner
sartak: these stones are wayyyy not connected
Magnetic Spark: *side
sartak: hehe, that was wishful thinking on your part :)
sartak: so, all that is why I think F17 might be a mistake]

(;W[hc]C[sartak: this move is also joseki
Magnetic Spark: oh
Magnetic Spark: I need to learn this one
sartak: yeah. it's called a pincer
Magnetic Spark: what's the correct foolow-up?
sartak: before we talk about black's followup let's talk about this H17 by white
sartak: what do you think it's trying to do?
Magnetic Spark: cut me apart
Magnetic Spark: or try to chase me into your "wall"
sartak: yes
sartak: a pincer specifically is designed to prevent you from making a base
sartak: in this case I chose it because it also starts to punish you for not finishing the joseki on the top right by jumping out
Magnetic Spark: it's so cool how that one move in the beginning dictated the whole pace of the game
sartak: yeah! you had no choice but to fight since you were robbed of a base
Magnetic Spark: that's good enough for me :P
]

(;B[dc]C[sartak: your followup was good
sartak: the other way to respond is by jumping out immediately
Magnetic Spark: but that's not too great for black since white develops at the same time as he chases me
Magnetic Spark: and white would chase black into his wall or to the corner
sartak: yep :) and that was my plan the entire game
sartak: so your move here does try to make a base, but it's hard because it's touching a white stone]

;W[cc]C[sartak: this was me trying to stop you from going into the corner to get your two eyes
sartak: and also just, like, start fighting :)]

;B[cb]C[sartak: I didn't know how to respond to this]

(;W[bc]C[sartak: this was how I played in the game
sartak: it keeps the pressure on you
sartak: so I played this which feels solid. but I don't like that it's on the second line]

(;B[db]C[Magnetic Spark: I made a solid connection there, but in retrospect it doesn't look so good
sartak: I don't know how to evaluate this move. could be good, could be bad
Magnetic Spark: since I can get sealed pretty easily
sartak: indeed]

(;W[ed]LB[ba:7]LB[ca:6]LB[da:5]LB[ea:4]LB[fa:3]LB[eb:1]LB[fb:2]C[sartak: so here I wanted you to connect
Magnetic Spark: so why you chose the iron pillar here?
sartak: because I wanted to start building up a wall
Magnetic Spark: wasn't a 1 space jump just as good?
Magnetic Spark: because (i'm not sure if I read this out correctly), but even if you push in, the F18 cut is harmless
sartak: at best you'll get like 7 points of territory, maybe, but a wall is going to be very useful for the rest of the game]

;B[gd]C[sartak: I tend to play on the defensive side anyway. when I first started playing I lost a lot of big groups because I was careless... tonight felt a little bit like that all over again ;)]

;W[hd]SQ[fc]TR[hc]SQ[gd]TR[hd]C[Magnetic Spark: I do that all the time in 9x9
sartak: I played from this side and not the other side for two reasons
sartak: 1) to strengthen my single stone
sartak: 2) these four stones are good shape for white, bad for black]

;B[gf]C[Magnetic Spark: jump out to not get sealed in
sartak: yep!
sartak: though I do wonder if a cut works
sartak: all I have to do is chase you, basically, and I get to build walls while you run
sartak: you run this way in a straight line
sartak: straight lines don't really make territory by themselves
sartak: my hope was that I would get the blue lines
sartak: and then the left side becomes all mine, and the right side becomes a massive wall that eats everything
sartak: :)
sartak: it didn't quite go according to plan though ðŸ˜­]

(;W[if]C[sartak: why do you think I played J14 and not H14?
Magnetic Spark: because of the H15 follow up?
sartak: close
Magnetic Spark: I didn't spot that, that makes more sense
sartak: it's hard for you to push that direction when I play j14
sartak: also
sartak: I'm liking the way this is developing because I'm starting to build my box
Magnetic Spark: I see
sartak: and it'll be hard for black to escape very far from the top right corner]

(;B[kc]C[sartak: you must have sensed that :)
sartak: this was your next move in the game
Magnetic Spark: I wanted to make sure my base was safe, and I didn't want to give you the top
sartak: it was good thinking
sartak: and I was happy to let you have a base, but I made sure to profit from it]

;W[ld]C[sartak: I played this to force you to extend
sartak: this is a useful move to know, it's called a shoulder hit
sartak: it encourages your opponent to make territory while you make influence
sartak: and I was all about influence this game :)]

;B[lc]
;W[md]C[sartak: and yes, it turns out you don't need to connect
sartak: :)
sartak: but yes, white profited from this because I gave you a little territory to make my moyo even better
Magnetic Spark: yeah that side of the board got pretty scary in the midgame
sartak: the only troublesome spot was here since I didn't block you. so when you invaded I was worried you'd run there and make life
Magnetic Spark: I tried :P
sartak: but I ended up being able to seal you off in a sneaky way... a move that served two purposes
Magnetic Spark: my plan was to develop the bottom. and maybe run my group there later
Magnetic Spark: but it does give up the middle for that]

(;B[fq]C[sartak: I was surprised you played here
Magnetic Spark: should I have played on the other side?
sartak: I think so
sartak: this isn't bad though, since it's still a place to run to
sartak: and yeah, develops the bottom
sartak: so I guess I can't criticize it :)]

;W[cn]C[sartak: but now we play that joseki]

;B[dr]
;W[cq]
;B[ip]
(;W[ih]C[sartak: I didn't finish it with C10 since I knew I was going to continue attacking you
sartak: if I played C10 it would give you sente]

;B[df]C[sartak: and here's where it starts to go very badly for me :)
Magnetic Spark: this was a bit thin, but I thought E14 was too weak
sartak: I would have played E14 I think, but again I play defensively
sartak: (I just need to be better at readingâ€¦)
sartak: ideally I would have had a stone here so you'd have to keep going downwards
sartak: and that's something I struggle with... how to keep attacking from both sides]

;W[ef]C[sartak: since you did play the two space jump I decided I would try to cut]

;B[eg]C[Magnetic Spark: hane felt natural here]

;W[dg]TR[dd]TR[ed]C[Magnetic Spark: now that scared me
sartak: >:)
sartak: as well it should
sartak: the crosscut works very well because I have all this help right here
sartak: I was hopeful that this would seal off your group entirely
sartak: because I'd get to build up stronger walls
sartak: while you struggle
sartak: of course, that was my hope :)
sartak: a little too optimistic]

;B[cf]C[sartak: I'm glad that you didn't immediately atari in either of the crosscuts in this game
sartak: the proverb says to extend the weaker stone
Magnetic Spark: that's mostly because of the proverb I saw
sartak: which you did!
sartak: exactly]

;W[dh]C[sartak: but
sartak: you're in a lot of trouble here because there's nowhere for your two stones to go
sartak: the trouble started for you with that two space jump
sartak: this was me punishing you for the overplay]

;B[fg]LB[ee:B]LB[ff:A]C[sartak: I remember struggling with my response to this move
Magnetic Spark: I took me pretty long to decide on where to play black 41
sartak: the usual move at A for me would be foolish because of your stone next to it
sartak: but I didn't want to just sacrifice this cutting stone
sartak: so I had to protect it somehow
sartak: B felt like it didn't put any pressure on you
sartak: you may have noticed a theme with my moves... pressure pressure pressure
Magnetic Spark: and B would make you overconcentraded
sartak: mmhmm]

;W[fe]LB[ff: ]C[sartak: so I think this is the only move for me
sartak: in the end I decided it was okay because it makes a tiger's mouth
sartak: it feels silly but specifically focusing on making good shapes seems to help a lot]

(;B[ge]C[Magnetic Spark: but in the end i settled for the easy way out :P
sartak: you did :)]

;W[fd]C[Magnetic Spark: I wanted to reduce liberties]

(;B[ec]C[Magnetic Spark: now I connect because the cut was  too painful
sartak: when I played F16 I expected you to connect at G17 not E17
sartak: you're right, this connection was better
sartak: nice reading]

(;W[ce]C[sartak: this was me taking away a liberty while also giving myself a bit of an escape route]

;B[be]
;W[bd]C[Magnetic Spark: hane here felt safe, so I went for it :P
sartak: and again
sartak: haha, it's funny
sartak: I thought the hane made you feel weaker
sartak: since look, that stone has only two liberties! no problm]

;B[ee]C[sartak: this was a great move]

(;W[ff]C[Magnetic Spark: I spent a long time on it, but in the end I couldn't read all the way to the end
Magnetic Spark: but I felt like I had more liberties in the capturing race, so I could figure out later :P
sartak: I'm awful at reading so I didn't read it either]

;B[de]
;W[cd]
;B[bf]
;W[bb]
;B[ba]
;W[ae]
;B[ad]
;W[ac]
;B[af]
;W[ab]
;B[ad]
;W[gg]C[sartak: I played this to make myself a little stronger to have a chance after that big capture
Magnetic Spark: I felt like E13 was important if I wanted to attack D13, so I was trying to save it
Magnetic Spark: not sure if that wasa  good exchange]

;B[gh]
;W[hg]
;B[ei]C[sartak: :)
sartak: you're right]

;W[eh]
;B[fh]
;W[di]C[sartak: these were all moves to help me build my wall on the left]

;B[ej]
;W[dj]C[Magnetic Spark: I think I probably shouldn't have tried to save those 2 stones after all]

(;B[gj]C[Magnetic Spark: but in the process, you solidified your moyo on the center right
Magnetic Spark: I played black 69 to make shape, the E13 group was still feeling pretty weak
sartak: nod
sartak: I think it was a bit passive
sartak: oh wait. we're silly
Magnetic Spark: if black plays H7, white can cut and make something work probably
Magnetic Spark: well, it's not like I could read that far ahead anyway
sartak: it's definitely very complicated if black does not protect :)
sartak: same]

;W[ij]C[sartak: and on the right
Magnetic Spark: and help out my weaker groups, but you did cut so it didn't owrk]

(;B[il]C[Magnetic Spark: so here I was unsure of what to do
sartak: this isn't bad
Magnetic Spark: I wanted to poke white's large area on the center
sartak: but I think I immediately tried to cut]

;W[hk]C[sartak: I don't think I have any good comments on these moves. they seem pretty obvious I guess]

;B[gk]
;W[hl]
;B[fm]C[sartak: this all seems good
sartak: the cut isn't that important since you have life on both sides of it
sartak: but it does give me a chance to build up strength]

;W[el]C[Magnetic Spark: I didn't want to extend at E9 because it felt bad if you also extended]

(;B[em]C[sartak: your response in the game was perfectly good]

;W[dm]
;B[dl]C[sartak: I forgot about this crosscut
sartak: there's an exception to that proverb about extending the weaker stone
sartak: if you can 100% capture a cutting stone, just do that
sartak: so that's why I atari'd]

;W[dk]
;B[cl]C[sartak: and then I had to connect. which I was happy to do because it also helps attack you]

;W[ek]LB[bh:A]C[sartak: I was waiting the entire game to play A though
sartak: to stop you from playing there and reducing
Magnetic Spark: that group doesn't seem too healthy]

(;B[fk]C[Magnetic Spark: I think B7 was a pretty huge move for both of us
Magnetic Spark: I was wondering if you would play there or not
sartak: why this move?
sartak: reducing liberties?
Magnetic Spark: I didn't want you to grab E11
Magnetic Spark: and also that
sartak: fair enough]

;W[gm]C[Magnetic Spark: buti t makes bad shape, so I wasn't sure]

;B[fo]
;W[gn]
;B[fn]
;W[fp]C[sartak: I felt evil playing this
Magnetic Spark: I was pretty invested in the idea of killing your D12 group, so I was trying to salve all my surrounding stones
sartak: I need to be even more defensive I think :)
sartak: you atari'd the safe way though]

(;B[gp]C[Magnetic Spark: I wasn't sure if it was a waste of time or not, so I saved it]

;W[ep]C[Magnetic Spark: yeahm I just wanted to makre sure that group lived
sartak: I did briefly think about capturing F6 but I didn't think I'd get both G5 and F8
Magnetic Spark: I only noticed because of the game I played yesterday against kid, I had a huge group and let it die for free because I wasn't paying attention :P]

;B[go]C[sartak: just like that :)
sartak: you did great at that :)
sartak: against me, I mean]

(;W[im]C[sartak: I didn't know where else to play
sartak: since there was nothing left for me to attack really
Magnetic Spark: I decided to sac that stone
sartak: yeah, it was good that you did
sartak: it gave you a chance to prepare for your invasion
Magnetic Spark: right now, it still loos like white is favoured though doesn't it?
sartak: yeah, I'd say so
Magnetic Spark: you can reduced my top group pretty well, and the center is big
Magnetic Spark: I was banking on killing the left side, otherwise I was done fore
sartak: that is definitely a lot of points
sartak: I really didn't see that group as in too much danger haha
Magnetic Spark: yeah I remember that]

(;B[lo]C[Magnetic Spark: also, turns out the stone at J8 did some work late game, if it wasn't there I would need 1 more move to kill the large group
Magnetic Spark: but by then you'd have connected
sartak: I didn't have time to capture it :(
Magnetic Spark: n8?
sartak: I don't know how to invade. but I have had success turning moyo into giant territories
sartak: I gotta play more! ]

;W[qm]C[Magnetic Spark: so I should've placed somewhere around M8 instead of attaching? ]

(;B[rm]C[sartak: when you attach directly like this it makes your opponent's stones stronger]

;W[rl]
;B[rn]
;W[pm]C[sartak: see? the gate is closing :)
sartak: but here is where you made a big jump in]

;B[ll]C[sartak: those two stones make it harder for you to run away]

;W[kl]C[sartak: now here is a useful move for you to know
sartak: I attached. which makes your stone stronger. I did that on purpose
sartak: because I wanted you to either:
sartak: 1) continue going up, therefore commiting yourself to the invasion
sartak: in which case my response would have been to hane below to cut you
sartak: and then it's really really hard for you to make life since everywhere you turn it's white thickness
sartak: OR
sartak: 2) back off and go down
sartak: in which case I would have hane'd above you to block your invasion
sartak: and turn my moyo into territory
sartak: you ended up choosing 3) fight!
Magnetic Spark: I felt like I had no choice]

;B[kk]C[sartak: I agree
Magnetic Spark: the center was way too large to give it up
sartak: you had to be bold]

;W[lk]C[sartak: even more fun :)]

;B[jk]
;W[jl]C[sartak: you really can see a theme in all of my moves: make a big moyo and then turn it into territory
sartak: even little ones like this
Magnetic Spark: yeah]

;B[hn]C[sartak: I wasn't sure why you played this
Magnetic Spark: here I was trying to make you overconcentraded
sartak: maybe because of time?
sartak: ah]

(;W[in]C[Magnetic Spark: possibly forcing you to capture J8 later on
sartak: if only I did! hehe]

;B[ji]
;W[ii]C[Magnetic Spark: I kinda ran out of time during this move :P
sartak: all I have to do is play defensively though, and be careful of you making eyes, and then I would have been fine
sartak: this is where I start playing very defensively
sartak: because my assumption is you won't be able to make two eyes
sartak: so by responding defensively, I get to fix all of my defects, and I don't have to worry about you breaking through my walls
sartak: and
sartak: if I were to attack you
Magnetic Spark: there's nowhere to run
sartak: you might stop trying to invade
sartak: and instead just try to reduce
sartak: sacrificing those stones
sartak: and then I don't profit as much
sartak: it'll be a lot easier to attack your top and bottom if I have a lot of strength caused by you trying to survive inside my moyo
sartak: I really screwed up by letting you capture! ]

;B[kg]
;W[mh]
;B[ke]
;W[kd]
;B[jd]LB[if:A]C[Magnetic Spark: here I was desperately trying to connect
sartak: gotta be careful with those hanes when there are nearby stones

;B[jc]

;W[nf]
;B[le]

sartak: since you could always push in from O17]

;B[of]
;W[lf]
;B[pe]
;W[pf]C[sartak: I might have been able to ignore 1 move earlier in the invasion to close that wall

sartak: hope this was helpful for you. it was for me. I have to get better at spotting my weak groups
Magnetic Spark: is it possible to make D12 alive?
Magnetic Spark: thanks for the review :)
sartak: the fighting started at turn 12 and lasted the entire game
sartak: sorry about that ðŸ˜‡
sartak: thank you too! this was fun
Magnetic Spark: little moves make such a big impact, I find it mesmerizing
Magnetic Spark: I had fun too :)
sartak: I'd like to play you again soon. after I do lots of tsumego
sartak: you earned it :)
sartak: you put up with my bullying for 160 moves then crushed me
