C[Standard reply.];W[pi]
C[I guess this is joseki, but in any case, I don't need to respond to it.]
;B[cn]
C[Approach the other side to try to build a moyo.];W[cl]
C[But he isn't having any of that!];B[cq]
C[Jump into the corner and take the cash.];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq]
C[This seemed like a mistake so I tried to punish, but it ended up going very poorly for me!]
(;B[bp]
C[This move is a mistake. I've added a joseki Anki card for it. No mas!]
;W[bo];B[bq];W[co]
C[Continuing with the normal joseki as if nothing were wrongâ€¦];B[fq]
C[Here I clamp to try to escape along the bottom.];W[er]
C[Of course he won't allow that.];B[ep]
C[So, cut! Now he has two weak groups to worry about.];W[dn]
(;B[fp]
C[My response is very noncommittal. I tried to keep the possibilities of attacking both sides open. In the end I lost everything instead.

I should have leaned on the upper group then captured the bottom group.]
;W[fr]
(;B[hq]
C[Here I knew that if I had hane'd he would have cut and captured, so instead I let him run out a bit. What I didn't consider is this gives him more liberties than my corner group.]
;W[gr]
(;B[hr];W[dr]
C[Now at this point I realize I'm screwed, and see what I can do to get compensation.]
;B[bn]
C[Can I just connect out to get a bunch of liberties?];W[ap]
C[No];B[eo]
C[Can I capture your cutting stones?

(Also, can I build a wall?)];W[do]
C[No];B[en]
C[Are you sure I can't capture your cutting stones?

(Also, can I build a bigger wall?)]
;W[dm]
C[No];B[nq]
C[Here I begin to take advantage of the wall.];W[lq]
C[Gosh. Should have seen that coming.

I guess I can't blame him given how poorly the previous pincer worked out for me.]
;B[no]
C[But in this case since I have the wall I am fighting rather than just jumping into the corner.]
;W[lo]
(;B[nm]
C[I considered surrounding the corner but I figured since I am preparing a counterattack, better if it's more severe.]
;W[pm]
C[This seems dubious, but it's alright because now I get to counterattack.]
;B[lm];W[jo];B[jm];W[ho];B[hm]
C[I figure I'll keep jumping with him to build thickness, if nothing else.]
;W[fm]
C[This is a really good splitting move. I can't find a way to connect all three of my groups.]
(;B[em]
C[Here's me trying to reduce the liberties on the F7 stone.];W[el]
(;B[gm]
C[Here I'm prepping the cut, but I didn't read well.]
(;W[fn];B[gn];W[go]
C[Now I'm in big trouble.];B[io]
C[I wedge in the hopes of reducing the liberties on the H5 group enough that I can win the capturing race.]
;W[ip];B[in];W[gq];B[hp]
C[Here I'm thinking I can give up E4 to save H3 but it doesn't work.];W[gp]
;B[jp];W[iq]
C[The ladder doesn't work.]
(;B[ir];W[jq];B[kp]
C[I get this double peep for free, which is the most charitable explanation for why I played this way.]
;W[jr];B[kq];W[is];B[kr]
C[Here I continue pushing down to make sure my cutting stones are strong, even if it means white takes H2 off the board.]
;W[hs];B[fl]
C[Takung this free move on the outside while I can (it's probably a little late, to be honest) to build a little more influence.]
;W[fo]
C[So far this game is going horribly for me! But I have a lot of influence, so hopefully that can convert into a big center for me.]
(;B[qq]
C[Jump into the corner to try to get some points. In hindsight I do think an invasion around R9 would have worked better.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo]
(;B[pr]
C[God damnit];W[or];B[qr];W[oq]
(;B[ro]
C[Here I'm trying to escape. Descending with O2 probably would have been a better move, as it's sente.]
;W[qn]
C[This protects the cut at Q5.];B[pk]
C[Now I get the invasion in. I suppose I played on the fourth line to allow me to go either way.]
;W[mn];B[nn]
C[I blocked this way because the left side seemed less vulnerable.];W[mm]
;B[ml];W[nl]
C[Nice sequence; this cut hurts my invasion.];B[ol]
C[But I'm happy with my reply.];W[ll]
C[This sets him up to get his group out, either by capturing N8 or M7.];B[mk]
;W[mp]
C[I can't imagine he's trying to make the O6 group heavy to capture it, seeing as how O8 is very much captured, so I suppose this is to help him get all of his stones out.]
;B[np];W[km];B[ko]
C[Now I'm making sure my group can get out.];W[ln];B[kn]
C[Here I take a liberty and falsify his eye, while giving me a real one.]
;W[mr]
C[Here he connects up...];B[nr];W[ns]
(;B[lr]
C[This was perhaps my most foolish move of the entire game. I absolutely needed to cut at M4 instead. Instead this lets him connect all the way.]
;W[mq];B[mo];W[lp];B[kl]
C[Here I make use of his shortage of liberties to try to seal him in.];W[ms]
C[And he takes the bait.];B[rn]
C[Since I know I'm not connected, I need to make sure to make eyespace. The Q9 stone is now looking much more helpful.]
;W[rm];B[ql]
C[Peeping at the cut; if nothing else it sets me up for a more severe reduction.]
;W[ks]
C[Here he's saving his groups; fair enough. I can't block since it'd be self-atari.]
;B[jn];W[ls];B[qm]
C[And since he chose to connect on the left side, I can cut off this stone. Now I have a big corner and a good launching off point for further reduction. Not bad.]
;W[gl]
C[I did expect this move earlier and chose not to protect against it because he'd have an awfully tough time keeping his cutting stone alive near so many black stones.

Then again, those black stones have only one eye, and so they're not as safe as I'd given them credit for.]
;B[fk];W[hk];B[gk]
C[Here I wanted to make my now-cutting stones stronger.];W[hl];B[kk]
C[Now that I've strengthened my cutting stones, I can strengthen my center group. Not only does this seal in white's center group, it also starts to form eyespace. And it gives me something to push white into.]
;W[lm]
C[I suppose white is setting up to kill my center group by taking away the ko connection and prepping the cut at K8.]
;B[il]
C[So I defend against that cut, and maybe I can even make K8 into an eye. This also reduces a liberty on white's cutting stones.]
;W[hn];B[im];W[ik]
C[Here he's made my prospective eye at K8 false.];B[lk]
C[I know he can't cut at K8 now, so I wanted to strengthen my group considerably by sealing white in with a solid connection.]
;W[jk]
C[I suppose he needs as many liberties as he can get.];B[jl];W[ii]
C[Now it's a proper running fight.];B[gi]
C[Of course I block from this side because my cutting stones are way weaker than my center group.]
(;W[ig]
C[I was a little surprised he didn't jump to the right with L11.];B[gg]
C[I'm happy to keep running. He'll eventually hit my J17 stone.];W[li]
C[Two-space jumps can be cut, sir.];B[ki]
C[I didn't appreciate it at the time but this is a very dangerous move.]
;W[kh]
(;B[ji];W[kj]
C[Of course he has to cut.]
(;B[jh]
C[I suppose he thought I'd atari immediately, but that would lead to a black dumpling surrounded by a lot of white thickness.]
(;W[ih]
C[I was surprised he blocked this way to let me out. But there's a sequence that lets me out if he blocks at K13.]
;B[kg]
(;W[lh]
C[I suppose he doesn't squeeze me because then he would have no prospects for eyes in his J12 group.]
;B[jg];W[jj];B[lj]
C[Of course I have to cut.];W[nj];B[nk]
C[I have to capture; otherwise I'd lose my dragon.];W[oj]
C[I suspect he expected me to connect after this peep, but there's no reason to; the stones are already connected.]
(;B[lg]
C[So I work on saving my weakest group; my cutting stones.];W[mi]
C[And sure enough, he's worried about the cut (though I don't intend to do so, since it looks like all variations lead to bad things for me)]
;B[if]
C[And now to counterattack his own invading, cutting stones.];W[hf]
C[This is a gutsy hane.];B[hg]
C[I'm glad to see I was not kow-towed into defending against it directly.]
;W[jf];B[ie]
C[I now have two nets, so whichever side he attacks I can definitely save the other.]
;W[kf]
C[Naturally he attacks the more profitable side.];B[lf]
C[But it seems fairly foolish. I have liberties enough, and more importantly, places to run. He's already surrounded.]
;W[ke];B[le];W[kd];B[he]
C[Now that my group is relatively safe (it seems like he can't cut it off from the corner without sacrificing the L14 cutting group), I start to clean up the aji on the other side.]
;W[di]
C[Thus begins his reduction.];B[pg]
C[And me mine.

I wasn't sure how to respond to D11 anyway, so I figured I'd come back to it later.]
;W[qh];B[qg];W[rg];B[ph]
C[Here I'm trying to expose defects.

Poorly.];W[ri];B[nh]
C[This move doesn't do much for me; it doesn't threaten any white groups, nor does it do a good job of connecting my reduction to a safe group. ]
;W[pf]
(;B[og]
C[I was cowardly to not play the hane. It works fine for me.];W[of];B[nf]
;W[oe]
C[If I'd played the hane first, this double peep wouldn't have been available. Such is the price of cowardice.]
;B[od];W[ne]
C[Here I started to sweat a little.];B[ni]
C[But I take advantage of free moves while I can...];W[mj];B[oi]
C[Free moves...];W[pj];B[qj]
C[Free moves...];W[qi];B[me];W[rj]
C[Here he's fishing for his own eyespace.];B[rl]
C[I desperately want to maintain my connection to the corner; otherwise, both (probably) die.]
;W[qk]
(;B[pl]
C[This was a slack move.];W[pn];B[re];W[rk]
C[I misinterpreted this move. I thought he was trying to save his stone and cut my corner from my one-eye center group.

But he's really just fishing for his second eye. So I could have cut off his five stones and gotten a huge corner.]
(;B[sl]
C[So I drop the ball here.];W[rf];B[ld]
C[Now that all the connections are settled and all the free moves taken, we can return to the fight.]
;W[qe]
C[Here he's trying to see how much of the corner he can steal.];B[rd]
C[Of course I can't just block.];W[qd];B[qc];W[pc]
C[I was annoyed and a little offended to see this move but I guess it's legit enough that it's worth trying.]
;B[rc]
C[I connect strongly to avoid any aji.];W[oc];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[ob];B[lc]
C[Once again trying to avoid leaving any defects, and not letting him get away with any shenanigans around his L16 group.

At this point I'm somehow winning, by about 50 points.]
