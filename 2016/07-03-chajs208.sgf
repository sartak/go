C[Well then!];W[cf]
C[I'm not sure the best way to start breaking up black. I'm feeling like this is not it.]
;B[ef]
C[Seems like I ought to be able to punish this but I'm not sure how.]

C[So I'll play big too!];B[dg];W[ch];B[cg];W[bg];B[dh]
(;W[ci]
C[I couldn't hane here because it gives up B13 and most likely also C14. I extended from this side because the lower stones felt weaker.]
;B[di];W[ei];B[eg];W[ej]
C[Took me a while to figure out where to fix, but I'm really happy with having fixed here. "Outside is better than inside."

This exchange is not looking very good for black.]
;B[dm]
C[This was a bold move by black.];W[co]
C[First, remove his ability to extend this way, and push him towards my wall.]
;B[ck];W[cj]
C[After this exchange his attached stone looks awfully silly!];B[bj]
C[I suppose he's trying to make eyspace.];W[dk]
C[Strengthen my influence while I also threaten cuts.

I don't want to just seal him in, I want to kill to punish him for playing inside my wall.]
;B[cl];W[bi]
C[Threatens him but also protects my two weak stones above.];B[aj];W[ai]
C[This is of course sente.];B[bl];W[dl]
C[He's got one eye; I play here to both start sealing him in and threaten to cut.]
;B[cm]
(;W[bn]
C[Poke out his second eye!];B[en];W[fo]
C[Now he's on the lam. Time to earn lots of points!];B[fn];W[gn];B[fl]
C[This is kind of an overplay as I can peep it. Which I sure do to strengthen my weak stone.]
;W[gm]
C[Peep.]
(;B[fm]
C[Of course he has to defend.];W[dn]
C[Here I'm continuing to fatten the turkey while also building my own strength up to avoid a counterattack.]
;B[eo];W[fp];B[do];W[cn]
(;B[el]
C[Not sure if he thought it was a real eye or what but this is certainly not a useful move.]
;W[hk]
C[Now I decide to start sealing him in.];B[gl];W[hl];B[gk];W[gj]
C[The hane seems quite severe! But I'm starting to worry a little about defects I'm leaving.]
;B[fj]
(;W[gi]
C[Here I extend to avoid leaving any more weakness than I need to.];B[fk]
C[Again not really sure what he's thinking. He doesn't have to play this until I peep at E9.]
(;W[ij]
C[This is probably not a good move; I attached to a weak stone while I am strong. But I wanted to fix while also doing something else.]

(;W[fh];B[gh]
(;W[gg]
C[I atari this way because G11 is fairly safe; I don't want my dragon to get sealed in.]
