C[This move surprised me a little, seems like endgame. I suppose I should have taken R9 or something.]
;B[rr];W[pq]
C[Also wasn't expecting this move.]
(;B[rq];W[op];B[po]
(;W[oo];B[on]
C[This seems like a poor development for white. He's building a wall facing my stone, but so am I.]
;W[nn];B[om]
C[I'm certainly happy to push from ahead on the fifth line];W[nm];B[nl]
C[I probably should have just kept pushing instead.];W[ol]
C[IGS players love the cut huh.]
(;B[pl]
C[I atari'd the wrong way. Much better to push him toward my strength. It would also let me build a wall on the outside.

This was cowardice.]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[nk];B[ml]
C[This group was a liability for me the entire game.];W[mk];B[ll]
C[I continued extending knowing whichever way he blocked, I'd go the other way.]
(;W[ln];B[lk];W[mi]
C[Now his cutting stones are the ones on the run!];B[li]
(;W[pj];B[qj];W[pi]
(;B[mh]
C[I finally started to appreciate that my cutting group was the weaker one that needed all the extra moves.]
(;W[ni];B[qi];W[lh];B[kh]
C[I atari'd this way intentionally to give up the N12 stone and strengthen my cutting stones.]
;W[lg];B[ki];W[nh]
(;B[ph]
C[Instead of this, extending from atari at N13 looks like it would also be viable, as the ladder favors black.]
(;W[oh];B[pg];W[og];B[pf];W[qk]
C[This cut had no chance to survive; I guess he was just planting aji. It was a handicap game after all.]
;B[ql];W[rk]
(;B[rh]
C[Here I'm playing it super safe (and it ended up working for me in the final few moves of the game)]
;W[rl]
(;B[qm]
C[Can't hane because of the double atari.];W[kg];B[ih];W[ig]
(;B[hh];W[hg];B[gh];W[gg]
C[I keep pushing because I'm concerned about the viability of my cutting stones. It does sacrifice a lot since this is a seventh line wall, but I was confident I could live inside.]
;B[fc]
C[I can't let white get away with having the entire upper side, so time to do something about it.]
;W[hc]
C[Not surprised.];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[ce]
;B[be];W[bd]
C[This move again surprised me. Planting aji I spose. It does come back in a while.]
(;B[bf]
C[I don't want to be sealed in, especially since that blights my center group.]
;W[df];B[ch]
C[I'm not convinced this is the best move, but I'm pretty sure it's not a bad one.]
;W[dh];B[di];W[cg];B[bg];W[dg]
(;B[ci]
C[I don't think I needed to defend, as it looks like the cuts don't work well for white.]
;W[ei];B[fh];W[eh];B[fg];W[ff];B[jg];W[jf]
C[Here I'm setting up a potential cut later. Planting my own aji :)];B[gk]
C[This move took me a while. I didn't want to get cut.];W[fi];B[gi];W[ek]
;B[gm]
C[Again I didn't want to get sealed in, though at this point it's looking like I can make two eyes. And though white is reducing, it wasn't my territory to begin with, so I'm profiting.]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[ck]
C[He's quite aggressive!];B[dl]
(;W[dk];B[fj]
C[These peeps are pretty solidly sente, and help me a lot.];W[ej];B[cl]
C[Threatening to connect outwards, while also starting to turn the bottom left into a large moyo.]
;W[bk];B[fb]
(;W[da];B[ca];W[ea];B[bc]
C[I have to protect or I lose the entire side.];W[ad]
C[But I don't have to respond to this.];B[fq]
C[So I build territory and strengthen my connection.]
(;W[iq]
C[He takes advantage of his wall to build potential.];B[hp]
C[Shoulder hit to build a wall either facing a large corner (and pushing up to connect to my center group) or to build a wall facing upwards (to completely solidify my center group).]
;W[hq];B[ip]
C[Instead of drawing back cowardly, the best defense is a good offense!]
;W[jp]
(;B[in]
C[Now my connection is looking great. And I have followups.];W[el]
C[Now he can push in, as is his prerogative.];B[em];W[fl]
(;B[gl]
C[In playing out the variations it looks like connecting the other peep would have worked just fine.]
;W[fm]
(;B[en]
C[Can't just hane of course.];W[fn];B[go];W[fo];B[fp];W[eo];B[do];W[bl]
(;B[cm]
C[Protecting the other way would have been better, since it would have been connected. Also, empty triangle.]
;W[dn];B[cn];W[dm];B[jo]
C[I tenuki'd because I thought I was safe; the ladder favors black... but, I didn't take into account white's push at E4!]
(;W[kp]
C[Notice he didn't hane.];B[ko];W[lo];B[jm]
C[Here I wanted to block off white's intrusion, while also protecting a weakness.]
;W[gn];B[hn];W[ep]
(;B[eq]
C[If I had been on the ball, I would have realized I needed to extend first.]
;W[co]
C[Yep, I blew it here.]
(;B[cp];W[bo];B[bp];W[bn];B[lc]
C[Now at this point I want to reduce the upper side. I figured his most likely response is O17, but then he's playing into a pincer, and it's my turn next.]
;W[nc];B[oc]
C[So of course I kick.];W[nd]
C[And he responds the way I expected he would.]
(;B[nb]
C[Can I connect underneath?];W[mb];B[ob];W[mc];B[lb]
C[No really can I connect underneath?];W[ma]
C[Now at this point my corner is very well solidified, and I have quite a few stones inside his moyo, as well as some defects I can abuse. I thought I had a good chance of doing something.

It's a very close game, so I need to.]
;B[he]
C[This threatens cuts at G14 and J14, as well as threatening to surround H17. I'd been eyeballing this move for fifty turns.]
;W[if];B[id]
C[Here I'm threatening to connect up to my M18 group OR capture H17. Either way, two eyes likely.]
;W[gd]
C[Here he's avoiding getting surrounded. Which I'm fine with because all I want to do is make two eyes.]
;B[ic];W[hd]
C[I'm playing lightly so I can ignore the potential cut. That H15 stone doesn't help me make eyes.]
;B[hb]
C[Maybe I can make one or both eyes along the edge.];W[fa];B[le]
C[Or I can connect out. This threatens the cut at L14, which is severe if I can also play G14.

Basically, I'm trying to cause as much trouble as I can to look for two eyes.]
;W[ke];B[kd]
C[Trying to make eyespace.];W[je];B[lf]
C[Taking advantage of a defect he left for me, plus it aims for the outside connection.]
;W[ne]
C[He doesn't want me to connect out, or get cut himself.];B[mf]
C[Making use of that aji! If he lets me connect the N12 stone, I can cut at G14 and capture on a large scale.]
;W[mg]
C[Which means he can't stop me from at least cutting.];B[nf];W[of];B[oe]
C[Cut!];W[jd];B[jc];W[ga]
(;B[ge]
C[This was a wasted move. Instead I should have focused on making two eyes, or at least capturing N19.]
;W[fd];B[ha];W[kb]
C[This move is a lot more dangerous for me than I'd immediately realized. He can cut and capture something, which destroys my invasion.]
(;B[ka];W[jb];B[ja];W[la];B[ia];W[ie]
(;B[od]
C[This move nearly cost me the game! Because I didn't realize how precarious my position at the top was.]
;W[gb]
(;B[kc];W[ib]
C[Crud.];B[na];W[ld];B[gr]
C[Now it's just endgame.];W[gq];B[hr]
C[I wasn't worried about the cut, so I drove in a little bit more.]
(;W[ir];B[gp]
C[Not sure why I ended up connecting (perhaps because I felt I was the weaker player), but it did help me tremendously in reducing liberties for a later large-scale capture.]
(;W[bj]
(;B[bh]
C[Playing it safe even though I'm pretty sure B11 would have been fine too.]
;W[hs]
(;B[fs]

C[This was an overplay and he really paid for it. He had too many defects to do this.]
;B[mo];W[lm];B[lp]
C[Atari.];W[no];B[lq];W[jq];B[kr]
C[Here I was focused perhaps a little too much on capturing K3, and I could have pushed into his territory more. But, hey, didn't want to screw it up like I did the top!]
;W[mp];B[jr];W[mr];B[lr];W[mq]
C[Not sure why he felt the need to connect; maybe to take a liberty to force me to take his stones off the board.]
;B[kq];W[is];B[gs];W[jh]
C[He played the next several moves instantly. He must've been looking into them while I was taking my time reading the bottom middle situation.]
;B[ji];W[jl]
C[Atari.];B[kk];W[hj]
(;B[il]
C[I really blew it here. If I had calmly connected everything he would have had nothing.]
;W[gj]
(;B[fk]
C[I felt I had to connect otherwise he's in my territory.

But, seeing how the game turned out, I giving up the six stones instead is far worse.]
;W[ii];B[ij];W[eg];B[hk];W[hi]
(;B[jk]
C[I have to capture or otherwise protect because of a shortage of liberties.]
;W[rs];B[sr];W[ls]
(;B[js]
C[I played a gote move in response to white's gote move. Instead I should have taken sente, and then when white approaches at L1, then capture, then he has to connect in gote.

So I lost 2x sente with this move.]
;W[ms];B[ai];W[bi];B[ah];W[aj];B[ae];W[af];B[ac];W[pn];B[pm];W[rj]
C[I was surprised and a little annoyed when he reactivated this attack. There's no way he can survive.

But then again, he turns out to have been a few points behind, so I can't fault him for trying.]
