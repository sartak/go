C[This felt slow - could have played at A or something instead, but I wasn't sure how to punish it. Maybe I could have just ignored and tenuki'd.]

C[Ordinarily I'd play the star point but this felt more balanced.];B[jk]
C[This move surprised me but I ignored it.];W[oc];B[pd];W[qb]
C[Jumping into the corner. Perhaps not the best idea given it builds up black's side. But I also considered there was a good chance black would make an empty triangle.]

C[I wasn't sure how to respond. I was concerned about black's side but I don't think this was the correct answer.]

C[My sloppy thinking was: I didn't want 22 to get cut off, as well as starting to form a boundary around black.]

C[I suppose I could have played at A thanks to my stone on the star point which protects against the vulnerabilities I'd have if black cut at 30.]

C[Here I'm thinking I'll attack A with 62.

But again I didn't read it out. :(]
