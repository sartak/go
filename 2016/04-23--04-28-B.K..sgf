C[I think this should have been on the fourth line?];W[po]
C[Playing the biggest side.];B[ci];W[ck]
C[I think I pushed from the wrong direction. If I played C13, then I could have attacked when he played his two space base.]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[kc]
C[Well placed; gives him room to make a base on either side.];W[dg]
C[Shoulder hit to start to build up the outside and to seal black in.];B[cg]
;W[dh];B[pj]
C[Dude's opening is way better than mine. Though I think he could have been more severe by playing Q7.]

C[Another shoulder hit for the same reason.];B[gq];W[hp];B[ip];W[hq];B[hr]

C[I would not play this hane today.];B[fp];W[fo];B[ep];W[eo]
C[Though black didn't punish me for that hane.];B[dq]

C[My response should have been at C4 instead.];B[cr];W[bq];B[qm]
C[There's the pincerâ€¦];W[no];B[om];W[mm]
C[Really not sure why I went this way. I guess I didn't want to get sealed in and/or give black a gigantic moyo.]
;B[mp];W[np];B[nq];W[oq];B[or];W[op];B[nr];W[mo];B[lp];W[lo];B[jo]

C[Yuck! Have to play a poor shape move to protect against double atari.]
;B[ll];W[kp]
C[Causing trouble >:) He can't protect both sides.];B[kq];W[jp];B[km]
(;W[jq]
C[Much more interesting stuff happens if I atari the other way! I didn't even see it during the game, but I saw it here immediately. Getting better!]
;B[ir];W[lq];B[mq];W[lr];B[ml]
(;W[nk]
C[Why am I playing here at all? 

Much better would be to attack with R3!!! I can easily kill, looks like.]
;B[nj];W[mk];B[lk];W[mj];B[ni];W[lh];B[mh];W[li];B[lf];W[qq]

C[No need to take this stone; even if he tries to escape I ladder. If I feel compelled to play here S5 is surely better.]
;B[jg]
C[And sure enough he tenukis.];W[ji]
C[Man I was a fool to play those stones. It built up a huge black corner, and by attacking them he's going to profit lots. This center situation caused me a lot of grief, and rightly so.]
;B[jj];W[jl]
C[What the heck am I doing?];B[il];W[ii];B[ij];W[hi];B[hj];W[gj];B[go]
(;W[gn]
C[Glad I played this way because trying to save the three stones would have been a disaster.]
;B[ho]
(;W[gk]
C[This seems a little slow; one line down would have been better?];B[gm]
(;W[hm];B[hl];W[fn];B[gl];W[lg]
C[Now I decide to start crawling into black's corner to reduce it.];B[lj]
;W[mi];B[mn];W[mg];B[ng];W[mf];B[me]
C[He's playing too close, leaving lots of defects.];W[nf];B[og];W[of];B[pg]
;W[pf]
C[I'm halving his territory, not bad.

I do wonder if a 3-3 invasion at this point would have been better.]
;B[qf];W[od];B[oc];W[nd];B[nc];W[md];B[ld];W[kf];B[le];W[jf];B[hc]
C[Looks (to me, now) like he's trying to make eyespace.];W[hd];B[gb];W[id]
;B[ic]
C[I'm fine with that; it helps solidify a giant corner for me.];W[nl]
C[Now crawling as much as I can just to reduce.];B[nm];W[nh];B[oh]

C[This was gote.];B[oi];W[ok];B[qk];W[fk]
C[Trying to seal him in.];B[fb];W[eb];B[df];W[ef];B[de];W[ee]
C[Certainly fine giving up a stone (which still has aji) to seal him in. ]
;B[gc];W[fd]
C[Trying not to leave defects!];B[gd];W[ge];B[bc];W[bb];B[ab];W[ba];B[bk]
;W[cj];B[cl]
C[This was an overplay.];W[bj];B[aj];W[bl]
(;B[ak];W[al]
C[Here he asked for an undo, but I didn't grant it because it's a correspondence game. So, certainly not a misclick but a misread.

It was a pretty close game; it may have been the losing move.]
;B[ag];W[ai];B[br]
(;W[ar]
C[Certainly too early for such small endgame moves.];B[cd];W[dc]
(;B[qe]
C[Definitely should have gotten this move in before him!

He can't play Q15 because his P13 group is too weak.]
;W[pe];B[pc];W[mc]
(;B[mb];W[lc];B[kd]
C[He has to fix a defect here instead of blocking. Which means N18 was an overplay.]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[nb];B[ob];W[na];B[oa];W[ma];B[jd]
C[Now I recognize this as making eyespace.];W[je];B[jr];W[js];B[is];W[ks]
;B[pk];W[sm]
C[This monkey jump nearly cost me the game because of the capturing race that it triggers.]
;B[rn]
C[This monkey jump is rather tricky to deal with.];W[sn];B[rl];W[sl];B[sk]
;W[so];B[ro];W[sp];B[rk];W[kj]
C[I could have started playing the capturing race but I knew I had it.];B[kk]
;W[ki];B[rm]
C[There's a capturing race in this corner; have to be very careful, I can't fall a move behind.]
;W[qp];B[fl];W[el];B[ek]
C[I don't see any virtue in this move.];W[em];B[hk];W[gi];B[ne];W[oe];B[ka]
;W[fm];B[jk]
C[Unfortunately he saw my attack :) But hey, sente!];W[fa];B[ga];W[ea];B[ss]
;W[sq]
C[Filling to avoid a double ko.];B[ol]
C[This is not a ko threat. I'm not sure why he took the ko so early.];W[mh]
;B[la];W[mb];B[ah];W[aj];B[on]
C[This is a sneaky move that helps the capturing race along, so I respond in kind.]
;W[kq];B[kn];W[ls];B[pn];W[ns];B[ln];W[rs];B[aq]
C[This was a weak ko threat. I should have taken.]
(;W[ap];B[ss]
(;W[hp]
C[A better ko threat would have been A14, and it also  has a followup threat at B14 if needed.]
;B[qn];W[rs];B[ie];W[ps]
C[I must've just been getting sick of the anxiety so I finished the ko.]
;B[if];W[kg];B[he];W[gf];B[ig];W[hg];B[hf];W[gg];B[ih]
C[I think he forgot about my threat, since this move is 1 point.];W[gp];B[hq]
